HOUSTON — The Baltimore Orioles won’t see the defending World Series champion Houston Astros again until the final series of the regular season, and after being swept out of Minute Maid Park with a 3-2 loss Wednesday afternoon, they had seen enough. For the first two nights, the Orioles indulged two pregame ceremonies, a championship banner unveiling Monday and ring ceremony Tuesday. Without all the hoopla, the Orioles played their most competitive game of the series Wednesday but still dropped their fifth straight game. Right-hander Miguel Castro couldn’t keep the game tied in the seventh, hurt by a one-out walk to Derek Fisher when Fisher stole second and scored on Alex Bregman’s RBI single. The Orioles’ opening-month gauntlet continues with four games against the division rival New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. As the Orioles struggled out of the gate, one of the lone bright spots has been right-hander Dylan Bundy. In his second start of the season, Bundy delivered his second quality start, the only Orioles starting pitcher to go more than five innings. Bundy allowed two runs — one earned — through six innings. Bundy leaned on his fastball — which had a little extra velocity from his first start on Opening Day, especially early in the game. He recorded eight strikeouts, mixing in his slider later in the game with an occasional changeup and curve to keep a dangerous Astros batting order off balance. — Baltimore Sun
