On Nov. 4, 1979, more than 60 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran. Four days later, ABC News debuted a show that would become a national staple. But “Nightline’s” original name was “The Iran Crisis–America Held Hostage: Day [fill in the blank].” Each night, the show updated the nation on the latest news of the efforts to secure the hostages’s release until freedom was secured 444 days later. On Jan. 20, 2017, President Trump was inaugurated and delivered his dystopian “American carnage” address. Since then, he has upended presidential norms and the presidency itself. Most galling in a litany of unprecedented offenses (because he ceded the moral authority of the Oval Office by doing so) was his “very fine people” footsie with white supremacists after the horror of Charlottesville. [ ‘The first white president’ is a ‘bad dude’ ] Monday, April 9, marks Day 444 of the Trump administration. America is being held hostage by a spectacularly unfit narcissist who refuses to grow into the job and a Republican-controlled Congress that refuses to hold him accountable. May our ordeal also end with the inauguration of a new president, preferably three years from now. Heck, I’ll settle for a Democratic takeover of the House seven months from now. Anything that will put an end to or a real check on this national nightmare. Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj  Subscribe to Cape Up, Jonathan Capehart’s weekly podcast
