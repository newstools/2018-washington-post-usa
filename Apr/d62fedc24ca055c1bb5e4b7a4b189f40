It’s hard to imagine the change that the Arctic has experienced in the past few decades. Shrinking sea ice, increased shipping volume, melting permafrost and decimation of habitat have all been well-documented but can also be unfathomable. This video, compiled using thousands of images from NASA satellites, attempts to illustrate the shift. In 2017, the Arctic had the lowest wintertime sea ice extent on record, which goes back to 1979. Sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere reaches its maximum extent in early March after a winter’s-worth of darkness and cold air. In 1979, sea ice covered about 6.4 million square miles. In 2017, it covered just 5.57 million square miles — a 13 percent reduction in less than the blink of an eye, geologically speaking. The loss of ice has significant repercussions for more than just polar bears and seals — although it’s true those species are fighting to survive. It changes the entire marine ecosystem in the north, driving new predators into previously-inhospitable water. Just like mosquitoes will be able to spread things like malaria to new parts of the world, new diseases will spread to the Arctic wildlife as well. The entire food chain will be put to the test. On top of the stress it puts on the animal world, it’s making global warming worse in and of itself. Ice reflects incoming solar radiation, but dark ocean water absorbs it, making things even warmer. Melting permafrost and frozen coastal shorelines releases methane gas that’s been stored in the ground for millennia. Methane, of course, is a very potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. From an anthropogenic perspective, it is opening up new shoreline for drilling and extracting even more fossil fuel that is to blame for climate change.
