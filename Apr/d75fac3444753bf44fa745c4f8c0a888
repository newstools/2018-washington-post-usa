CHICAGO — Many times this season, the Washington Wizards have shown a lack of interest, and, inevitably, this personality trait has led to losses. On Sunday, the Wizards’ detachment proved to be even greater than the power of a tanking opponent. The Chicago Bulls sent out a rotation that only made sense for a team in search for a high lottery pick, and yet Washington still lost, 113-94. Sunday marked the second straight afternoon start for the Wizards (42-35), who did not play John Wall in the second half of the back-to-back set. The effort and performance reflected these facts as Washington fell to a Bulls team that features no star players. Chicago did not play starters Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday in the second half and instead gave significant minutes to bench players Ryan Arcidiancono and Cristiano Felicio, and yet these Bulls — with 51 losses on the season and only 26 wins — still overpowered Washington through much of the game. The Wizards lost their grip in the first quarter and could not recover. With 3:12 remaining in the opening period, center Marcin Gortat found a cutting Markieff Morris for a dunk. The easy bucket had pulled Washington to within 22-21 and forced the Bulls to call time out. After the huddle, however, the Wizards turned to three reserves and the Bulls drilled four consecutive three-pointers during a 14-0 run. Chicago made 18 threes overall, the most Washington has allowed this season. Bulls rookie Lauri Markkanen led all scorers with 23 points and made 5 of 8 looks from beyond the three-point arc, but even he sat down through the entire fourth quarter. The Bulls didn’t need him — behind a cast of bench players, they still outplayed the sleep-walking Wizards.
