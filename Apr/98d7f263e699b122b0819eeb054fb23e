DETROIT — The Baltimore Orioles certainly signed up for this. Andrew Cashner likely did not. With six innings of three-run ball to notch his third straight quality start of the season, Cashner and the Orioles still came up on the wrong end of Tuesday’s 4-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers on a legitimately freezing night at Comerica Park. Cashner has given the Orioles a chance to win in three of his four starts since signing a two-year deal in late February to join the team’s barren rotation. They didn’t again, because four runs proved too many for the offense to overcome. After getting his first taste of a legitimate big league offense last year with the Texas Rangers, following years of low run support with the likes of the San Diego Padres and Miami Marlins, Cashner hardly could have thought that he’d run into such problems with the once-vaunted Orioles offense. sports   Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Sports Daily newsletter Sports news with a focus on D.C. area teams.

It wasn’t the seven scoreless innings he posted in his previous start, but Cashner kept the Orioles in it. The first-pitch temperature was 36 degrees, but the wind chill factor put it about 10 degrees cooler. There wasn’t much to spur the Orioles on, save for the hopes of beating a team not included on the list of playoff teams that litter their April schedule and jump-starting a season that’s been pretty cold itself. — Baltimore Sun
