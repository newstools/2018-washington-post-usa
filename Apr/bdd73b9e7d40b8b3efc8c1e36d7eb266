There’s probably one in every office — the guy who’s obsessed with food. Over the course of my career, I’ve been known as that guy. I confess, I love to eat. I also love the way food draws co-workers together and gives people a chance to chat with folks they don’t regularly interact with. Luckily for me, Slack, the internal messaging system at The Post, has a “leftovers” channel where people can drop in to let others know where there’s free food to be had around the newsroom. [Why Americans have stopped eating leftovers ] And I would leap from my desk to go find it. Before I left the company for another job recently, this happened so many times that some of my co-workers claimed that if you saw me speed-walking around the newsroom, it was most probably because I was on the prowl for something to eat. This I could not deny. Over time, my activity in the channel sparked considerable interest in my daily consumption of people’s excess food. This eventually led to an odd challenge: Could I live for an entire week off leftovers found around the building? Challenge accepted. The Washington Post First, some ground rules: 1) I wouldn’t announce when I was starting the challenge, so as not to affect the way people shared their food. 2) I would have to survive only on food shared through either the leftovers channel and other channels where people announced free food, or on items that people offered me directly. 3) I couldn’t buy anything and bring it in to the office. I could eat only what was shared. [How to choose the right container for storing your leftovers ] 4) The challenge would run Monday through Friday. If I found enough food in the newsroom, I could eat it at once, or save it to eat later, including after work. 5) I couldn’t load up on food at my desk before starting the challenge. I thought it would be easy. I was completely wrong. Here’s what happened. Monday: Hunger hit within two hours of my arrival at the office at 9 a.m. My body is accustomed to a number of small meals (around four or five) throughout the day, so having nothing to eat in the morning was a bad start. By the afternoon, I was not a happy camper. I took a turn around the newsroom and ran into a food reporter carrying some cake, which she graciously shared. Later, the Slack channel pinged with another opportunity, but I was too busy answering work emails to follow up. My stomach hated me and questioned my intelligence. Before I wrapped up for the day, a colleague swung by and dropped off two small brownies. I scarfed them down, hoping that my obvious hunger didn’t rouse any suspicion that I was starting the challenge. By the time I got home, I was questioning my decision to take on this challenge. The Washington Post Tuesday: The second day started off a lot better. In the morning a colleague offered me her breakfast sandwich, which tasted out of this world given that I hadn’t had anything of substance for more than 12 hours. That delicious leftover would be my only sustenance until the afternoon, when I came across a wonderful birthday-like cake with white frosting. I dove right in. Later, another colleague pinged me on Slack, asking whether I’d had lunch and offering me half her sandwich from Jimmy John’s (winning!). Tuesday is also the day The Post’s Food Lab announces leftovers after the staff finishes cooking, styling and photographing a slew of test recipes. I pretty much know the timing of the announcements, so I went down early and sat in the lab as they finished up. My stomach growled loudly, and I found myself salivating embarrassingly in front of the deputy food editor. I realized that I had made the rookie mistake of not bringing a doggy bag for later, but once the leftover announcement went out, I filled up a plastic plate and scarfed down as much as I could. Wednesday: I was grumbling as I got to work. I could already tell that I was struggling a little to form coherent thoughts. I found myself making more frequent laps around the newsroom looking for something to nosh on, as the Slack leftovers channel was disappointingly quiet. My boss notified me that there was a corporate event going on in the building, so I headed to the event space, where I came upon some apples, parfaits and pastries. I scooped up as much as I could, knowing that I would need to ration it out over the day.

That was the last meal for the day. This was the day when I really noticed that I was extremely tired and my body felt really funky. I was glad there were only two days of torture left. Thursday: I knew that this would be an easier day to get through. I had saved a parfait from Wednesday, and a meeting I attended brought in sandwiches and salad — a platter of heavenly options that had me drooling yet again. About an hour after the meeting, the leftovers channel dinged with some delicious treats. Scrounging around, I pulled in a cookie, some fruit and pasta salad, reserving most of this to consume later in the day, when my stomach would need some nutrients before I left work. It was enough to hold me over. One day to go, thank goodness. Friday: Unsurprisingly, things were quiet. My body seemed to have accepted the fact that it probably wouldn’t be fed until the afternoon. I remained sluggish but vigilant. The day blurred by, until an announcement on another Slack channel notified users of a potluck to celebrate a colleague’s engagement. It was just the boost I needed to complete the challenge. Chips, salsa, guacamole, brownies, cookies, coffee: It felt like a dream. I gorged on platters of goodies, stacking my plate and scuttling back to my desk, where I ate like a wild animal. When evening rolled around, I shimmied my way back to the potluck area and grabbed another plateful, saying a silent thanks to my good fortune and to generous people. lifestyle food        true Recipes newsletter Weekly recipes and more from our Food team.

No sooner was the challenge over at 12:01 a.m. Saturday than I was happily munching chips and salsa at my neighborhood bar, El Chucho, grateful that the ordeal had ended. Making it through the week was harder than I had expected. I’m used to eating healthfully, but for five days I was forced to survive on the bare minimum, most of it sweets, fatty foods and fruit. Even though my body adjusted to a degree as each day wore on, and I was able to function, I’ve promised never to put myself through such a test again. In any case, I won’t have to. I think I’ve made my statement. After this challenge, I have bragging rights as The Post’s leftovers MVP forever.
