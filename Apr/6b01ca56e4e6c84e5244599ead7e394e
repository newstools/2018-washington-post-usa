Question: One of your stories said that the federal government hires about 200,000 people a year. That seems high — are you sure that’s right? Answer: An Office of Personnel Management database shows that Uncle Sam hired about 215,000 people — excluding current federal employees changing jobs — during its fiscal year ending last September, almost exactly the average of the previous six years. Remember, many government jobs are seasonal, temporary or part time. Counting only nonseasonal, full-time, permanent employees — the core of the federal workforce — the government hired 109,000 from outside in fiscal 2017, about 6,000 above the average of the previous six years. Hiring basically offsets turnover. Across all categories, just under 200,000 of 2.1 million left the government last year, about 10,000 below average. In just the core categories, about 123,000 of 1.9 million left, about 3,000 above average. About half of employees who leave core positions retire; the large majority of the rest quit for various reasons. About 8,500 were fired in 2017 for performance or conduct reasons, 1,100 above average. Including other categories, reaching the end of a temporary position is another main reason for leaving. The figures exclude intelligence agencies and the self-funding U.S. Postal Service.
