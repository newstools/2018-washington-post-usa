“A Hard Day’s Night” sounds pretty good in Yiddish, and — who knew? — so does “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.” They’re performed with spunk by Deb Filler in her too-slender solo memoir at MetroStage, “I Did It My Way in Yiddish (in English).” It’s an underwhelming show that bounces along on comedian-musician Filler’s likability. The New Zealand native grew up as a flower child nursed on classic rock and protest songs; Filler strums her guitar and says, “Remember this one?” as she leads brief singalongs. If you grew up smitten by Peter, Paul and Mary, you’ll bond with Filler. Eventually she tells three good stories (apparently true, too) about musical Lens: Leonard Bernstein, Leonard Cohen and Lenny Kravitz. Her father survived the World War II concentration camps and once heard Bernstein lead a concert for displaced persons. Filler co-wrote the 2016 short film “Mr. Bernstein” based on this experience, and it’s screened in the middle of this show. entertainment theater_dance        true Entertainment News Email Alerts Big stories in the entertainment world as they break. Please provide a valid email address. The juicy Cohen story deals with an accidental encounter when Filler was driving for a car service and picked up Cohen at a pivotal point in his career. It’s not spoiling things to say that you’ll get a chance to sing along to “Hallelujah.” The Kravitz story cements the theme rolling throughout the show as Filler’s father perpetually longs to hear songs in Yiddish. Filler’s appealing — she can definitely tell a joke, and she knows her way around a guitar — but “I Did It My Way” could stand to have a little more than that up its sleeve.  I Did It My Way in Yiddish (in English) written and performed by Deb Filler. About 75 minutes. Through April 29 at MetroStage, 1201 N. Royal St., Alexandria. $45. 703-548-9044 or metrostage.org.
