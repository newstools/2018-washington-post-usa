Weeks after saying definitively that he would retire, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) on Monday expressed his strongest public support yet for Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who is running against a top Democratic recruit in the closely watched contest to succeed him. Corker wrote on Twitter that he would contribute to Blackburn’s campaign “now that the Republican primary has essentially concluded.” His support comes after last Thursday’s filing deadline for the race and amid a growing sense among Republicans that the general-election campaign could be competitive.  The relationship between Corker and his allies and Blackburn and hers has been tense in recent months. After Corker said last year that he would not run for reelection, Blackburn jumped into the race to fill his seat. But earlier this year, Corker reconsidered running before eventually standing by his decision to retire. As Corker pondered his future, many of President Trump’s political aides made it a priority to ensure that he did not reenter the race. Corker has been one of the most outspoken critics of the president, accusing him of “debasing” the country with his “untruths” and “name-calling.” According to a person familiar with Corker’s thinking, Corker had received an assurance from Trump to remain neutral in the race, had he reentered. powerpost  powerpost     false endOfArticle true   Please provide a valid email address. In late February, even after he said for a second time that he would not run, Corker did not throw his support to Blackburn. Democrats have recruited former governor Phil Bredesen to run in the contest. He is a well-known figure in Tennessee, and some public polls have shown Bredesen leading Blackburn. Republicans are defending a 51-to-49 seat majority in the Senate, making the Tennessee race a potentially pivotal contest in the fight for control of the upper chamber.
