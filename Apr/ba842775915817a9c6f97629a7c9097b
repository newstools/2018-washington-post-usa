Patrick Reed, a five-time PGA Tour winner, birdied nine holes in the second round, putting him 9-under and earning a two-stroke lead over Marc Leishman heading into the weekend. Reed is 4 for 7 in his career when either leading outright or sharing a lead after the second round and this marks the second time Reed has been in the lead at this point in a major championship. Using scoring average and strokes gained as a base for each golfer’s projected average score per round, and then adjusting for the difficulty of Augusta round by round — for example, golfers averaged almost three strokes over par in Round 1 in 2017 but improved that to par in Round 4 — Reed has an 41 percent chance to win the 2018 Masters, leaving Marc Leishman (21 percent) and Henrik Stenson (8 percent) with a lot of ground to cover. Sergio Garcia, the third favorite heading into the tournament, saw his chances implode after hitting five balls in the water hazard on No. 15 in the first round, turning in a 13, the highest score recorded on Firethorn, a 530-yard Par 5, and tying the record for the highest score on any hole in Masters history. He did not make the cut. [ How did Sergio Garcia shoot a 13 at the Masters? ‘You saw it.
