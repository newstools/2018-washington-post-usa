A woman and her dog were killed Saturday night on Interstate 95 in Virginia when the dog escaped from the woman’s car and she chased it, authorities said. State police said the incident occurred in Stafford County about 10 p.m. about a mile south of Exit 136. Katie M. Mason, 28, of Stafford, was headed south in a 2007 Toyota when the vehicle ran off the road and struck a guardrail, authorities said. After the impact, her dog fled from the vehicle. Mason chased the dog into the southbound lanes of the highway, police said. A southbound 2012 Honda was unable to avoid striking Mason as she ran through a travel lane, police said. She died at the scene. The dog was struck as well, and fatally injured. The crash remained under investigation, police said. On Monday night, her family released a statement. “We are deeply saddened with the loss of our free-spirited Katie, who was passionate about all creatures both big and small,” it said. “She was the fiercely protective momma to her fur-babies, Stella and Sapphire.” (The dog has been identified in several media accounts as Stella.) “Katie never thought twice about helping an animal or man in need. She served in the Army National Guard and Army Reserves as a medic. She graduated from VCU in 2013 with a degree in biology, and she remained an avid Rams basketball fan. A woman of many talents, Katie was also an artist, often illustrating her favorite subject: the cats,” the statement said. this story has been updated.
