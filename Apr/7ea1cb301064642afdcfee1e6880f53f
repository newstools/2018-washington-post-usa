Exceptional     Excellent     Very Good About 3 in 10 Americans adults don’t drink alcohol. We don’t hold that against them — we still invite these friends and family to dinner parties, weddings, graduation celebrations and other special occasions. But what to serve them for the toast? Martinelli’s sparkling cider has long been a standby alternative for Champagne. Now Welch’s offers another choice: A sparkling rosé grape juice that mimics the real thing almost to a tee, except for the buzz. A delicious way to “rosé all day.” Also this week, we have an outstanding cabernet franc from Argentina, two whites and a rosé from southern France, ideal for your patio dinners as the weather finally warms up. Rating: 2.5 stars Mendoza, Argentina, $27 Argentina is best known for its malbec, but cabernet does exceptionally well in Mendoza, too — both cabernet sauvignon and in this example, cabernet franc. The wine is a bit rough-and-tumble at first, but decant for an hour, or just let it open in your glass, and it smooths out to a stylish, fruit-forward New World-style red. Enjoy this with steak or hearty roasts. Alcohol by volume: 14.5 percent.

Rating: 2.5 stars Italy, $13 Remember when Soave was almost as synonymous with white wine as chardonnay? Well, your parents probably do. Soave has fallen out of favor, and that’s unfortunate. This zesty, citrusy beauty deserves to be on every patio table this summer. It’s terrific on its own, but you’ll want to have it with food — ceviche, grilled fish or shellfish, even pasta with red sauce. Delicious. ABV: 12 percent. Distributed by M.

Rating: 2 stars Languedoc, France, $9 Pale pink in color, scented with berries and melons, this lovely, inexpensive rosé is one of my favorites every year. It’s delightful by itself but is also great with spicy and garlicky foods, so think of this with your Sichuan carryout or light lunches on the patio. ABV: 11 percent. Distributed by Dionysus: Available in the District at Mediterranean Way Gourmet Market, Rodman’s, Whole Foods Market (Foggy Bottom, H Street, P Street, Tenleytown).

Rating: 2 stars Rueda, Spain, $15 The white wines of Rueda, in western Spain, are typically made with the verdejo grape. The flavor is reminiscent of the better-known sauvignon blanc (which several producers in this region are growing), but without the grassy pungency. Think tropical fruit flavors with nice but not bracing acidity and medium body. Enjoy this by itself, with olives or seafood salads. ABV: 13 percent. Distributed by Artisans & Vines: Available in the District at Cleveland Park Wine and Spirits, Rodman’s, Schneider’s of Capitol Hill. Available in Maryland at Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda, Fenwick Beer & Wine in Silver Spring, O’Donnell’s Market in Potomac, Takoma Park-Silver Spring Food Co-op in Takoma Park. Rating: 1.5 stars United States, $4 lifestyle food        true   Please provide a valid email address. Okay, so it’s not technically a wine, but in many ways it can pass as one. This new release from Welch’s has the right body, the right acidity and dryness for rosé, and it is tasty and refreshing. The only thing missing is the alcohol. Wine lovers may raise their eyebrows at the familiar Welch’s flavor of Concord grapes, but this is ideal to have on hand for dinner parties, celebrations such as bridal showers, weddings, etc., where anyone may prefer not to drink wine but still be included in the fun. ABV: 0 percent. Widely available in your supermarket’s juice aisle. Availability information is based on distributor records.
