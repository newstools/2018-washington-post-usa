After some initial sluggishness, the national media is digging into claims by MSNBC host Joy Reid — who helms “AM Joy” on weekend mornings — that objectionable comments on decade-old blog posts are the result of hacking. On Tuesday night, MSNBC released documents, including a statement by security analyst Jonathan Nichols, advancing the case that various homophobic remarks stemmed from intrusions into her now-shuttered blog, the Reid Report, and “screenshot manipulation.” Reid and company have referred the alleged hacking to law enforcement. And that’s the thread that MSNBC is grasping for its official position on the matter. “The matter has been brought to the attention of law enforcement and we’re letting that process play itself out,” notes a company source. That’s not good enough, for a number of reasons. MSNBC and NBC News have the resources to do more than sit on the sidelines of a possible criminal investigation. Time to sit down with the links, the tweets, the screenshots, the archives and the rest of the evidence.
