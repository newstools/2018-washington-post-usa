At some point during Paul Ryan’s almost 20-year tenure in Congress, it emerged that the House Speaker liked the rock band Rage Against the Machine — a surprising choice for a conservative politician championing the power of the free market, given that the band’s leftist lyrics rail against capitalism and corporate America. Guitarist Tom Morello seethed in Rolling Stone after hearing in 2012 of Ryan’s alleged fandom, which was reported in the New York Times, and wrote that it was “amusing, because he is the embodiment of the machine that our music has been raging against for two decades.” Morello must have been pleased to hear on Wednesday that the congressman has decided not to seek reelection this year. After all, Ryan eventually told the New York Times, “They were never my favorite band. I hate the lyrics, but I like the sound.” Some of those despised lyrics just happen to do a great job of describing Ryan’s time in Congress. Here is the story of a politician many on the left love to hate, told through the song titles of a band that he supposedly loved and then hated. “Mindset’s a Threat” Ryan has long been interested in Ayn Rand’s writing, which his critics finding troubling. “Fistful of Steel” Using his platform as runner-up for Time Person of the Year in 2011, Ryan espoused the virtues of the P90X workout — with a photo shoot of the congressman pumping iron with a backward red hat and petite gray shorts. “Microphone Fiend” Joining presidential candidate Mitt Romney on the 2012 Republican ticket, Ryan debated Vice President Joe Biden in Danville, Ky., where they memorably “tangled fiercely and noisily,” according to The Washington Post story. “I’m Housin’” After Romney lost the election, Ryan made a “low-key” return to the House floor. “Know Your Enemy” Following a government shutdown, Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray led negotiation efforts in 2013 that resulted in a 2-year budget deal. “Guerrilla Radio” Ryan’s 2014 comments about inner cities on the radio show “Bill Bennett’s Morning in America” landed him in hot water. “Freedom” A group of the most conservative members of the House — the Freedom Caucus — constantly thwarted former speaker John Boehner, who eventually resigned in 2015. Ryan was soon elected Speaker. “Voice of the Voiceless” In June 2016, Ryan unveiled an anti-poverty agenda that, in part, recommended shifting money from federal control to organizations “who are actually successful in fighting and winning and beating back poverty.” (Of course, there were vocal critics of the proposal.) “Renegades of Funk” Ryan grew confused when the 17-year-old son of Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) dabbed — which refers to a dance move born from the Atlanta hip-hop scene — at his father’s swearing-in ceremony. Ryan thought the young man was sneezing. The congressman later dabbed in front of CNN’s Jake Tapper, to prove he knew the move. “Bulls on Parade” The day before the 2017 inaugural parade, president-elect Trump told Republican Party leaders just how much he and Ryan got along: “I’m starting to really, really love Paul. . . . I just want to let the world know, we are doing very well together. We agree.” Of course, this wasn’t quite true. The two had a fairly combative relationship leading up to the election, and Ryan frequently denounced Trump’s actions. Both can be stubborn when they want to be — or, as some would say, bullish. “Take the Power Back” After the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017, Republicans controlled the House, Senate and the White House, ending eight years of split party rule. “Roll Right” Ryan presided over a Republican rewrite of the tax code. “In My Eyes” In an attempt to look cool in his children’s eyes, Ryan announced that he overdoes it on emoji whenever he texting them — treating America to an emoji overdose of its own with this tweet. Because my kids don’t think of me as an emoji guy, I go crazy on emojis whenever we text. 🇺🇸👍🎉😂❤😊🔥💯☘ #WorldEmojiDay pic.twitter.com/mohyz2Dt9e “Township Rebellion” Last July, the Post reported that Republicans were losing control of their party despite having full control of the government. From the story: Frustrated lawmakers are increasingly sounding off at a White House awash in turmoil and struggling to accomplish its legislative goals. President Trump is scolding Republican senators over health care and even threatening electoral retribution. Congressional leaders are losing the confidence of their rank and file. And some major GOP donors are considering using their wealth to try to force out recalcitrant incumbents. “Sleep Now in the Fire” Critics have often accused Ryan of being too quiet or complicit during this tumultuous political era. “Tire Me” The politician announced on Wednesday that he will not seek reelection this year. Ryan told reporters of the GOP tax bill that passed last year, “That’s something I’ve been working on my entire adult life.” After two decades, he’s tired.
