First lady Melania Trump and Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, visited the National Gallery of Art  Tuesday morning to take in the museum’s new exhibition of Cézanne’s portraits. The West Building opened to the public 90 minutes later than usual to allow for the pair’s visit, a museum spokeswoman said. The exhibition, which opened last month, features 60 works that explore the role that portraiture played in the French artist’s development. Washington Post art critic Sebastian Smee described the exhibit as “riveting.” [The sourest, meanest mouth in the history of portraiture] The event is part of the busy schedule of Macron’s official state visit, the first of the Trump presidency. The schedule included a private tour and dinner at George Washington’s Mount Vernon on Monday and a lavish state dinner at the White House on Tuesday night.
