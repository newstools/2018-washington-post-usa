America’s deficit is growing sharply and will surpass $1 trillion per year by 2020, the Congressional Budget Office reported Monday. The federal deficit will hit $804 billion in fiscal year 2018, a 21 percent increase from 2017’s deficit of $665 billion, CBO said. President Trump and congressional Republicans in December passed a new tax law projected to cut government revenue by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. In March, members of both parties approved a funding measure to increase military and domestic spending by nearly $300 billion over the next two years. Together, the new measures will add $1.6 trillion to deficits over the next decade, CBO reported. The ballooning deficits reflect a growing gap between the level of military services and social spending the government is promising and how much it’s willing to tax Americans to pay for them. The current national debt totals more than $20 trillion. “We’ve had a big tax cut and a big spending increase, and they’re showing up here,” said Benjamin Page, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think-tank. CBO reported that from 2021 to 2028, deficits will average 4.9 percent of the total American economy — higher than at any point since World War II other than during the recession of 2008 and 2009. Annual deficits topped $1 trillion from 2009 to 2012, due to greater spending on social safety net programs and economic stimulus, as well as slumping tax receipts as the economy cratered. But the current deficit increases come amid steady economic growth and low unemployment. In passing the tax law, Republicans promised it would spur massive economic growth, with new prosperity helping to bolster the government’s finances, but few nonpartisan economists predicts the tax law could deliver the level of growth promised. CBO Monday raised its projections of annual economic growth, saying the U.S. Gross Domestic Product will increase by 3.3 percent in 2018.
