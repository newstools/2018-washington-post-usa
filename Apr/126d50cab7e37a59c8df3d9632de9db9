 A special guest accompanied István Várdai to the Phillips Collection’s concert series on Sunday — the oldest surviving cello crafted by Antonio Stradivari. For the past 18 months, the Hungarian cellist has been playing the instrument, which dates to 1673, when Stradivari was on the cusp of a brilliant instrument-building career. Várdai demonstrated to a fascinated audience that the instrument, formerly in the hands of Jacqueline du Pré and Lynn Harrell, is larger than most cellos, with wood and thickness that are more like a double-bass. Indeed, Várdai produced a sonorous bass register, especially in Bach’s Suite for Solo Cello No. 5. Where other cellists might struggle with the low writing, as on the sustained pedal notes of the Prelude, Várdai’s tone glowed with oaky complexity. He waded through the opening section of the Prelude with improvisatory freedom, pacing the subsequent fugue more strictly. The dance movements were generally more quick than stately. Várdai mined the Sarabande for maximum expression without slowing it to a dirge. His recording of the whole set, released last year by Brilliant Classics, is well worth a listen. The unusual Strad posed trouble high on the A string, where Várdai didn’t always have precise control of tone color and intonation. He crooned his way through such passages in Ligeti’s Sonata for Solo Cello with a moaning, longing sound on the distinctive pizzicato-glissando sighs and sweet cantillation reminiscent of folk music. The sounds of folk instruments are imitated even more prominently in Kodály’s Sonata for Solo Cello. The slow movement was especially moving, and Várdai’s flexibility of tempo in the light-footed finale felt impeccably natural. In a lovely programming touch, the pizzicato glissandi near the end of Kodály recalled the Ligeti at the top of the menu. And the Prelude from Bach’s first solo cello suite served as dessert.
