An unfortunate aftereffect of the strictures enforced by Samuel Beckett during his lifetime, and now by his estate, on productions of “Waiting for Godot” is that every version seems more or less the same. Some are drier, some funnier, some richer in personality, but multiple sittings through the absurdist masterwork elicit some semblance of the sensation that if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen ’em all. Not to take anything away from the estimable, affectionate staging brought to Shakespeare Theatre Company by Ireland’s Druid theater, but I wager that a revisit is essential only for those who’ve never had a “Godot” experience, or for those who can never get enough. With great works of theatrical art, and “Godot” is one of those, it’s true that you can always hear a line spoken differently, or see a bit of business in a new light. But the rather severe limitations imposed on directors of “Godot” — ask Joy Zinoman, Studio Theatre’s former artistic director, about the hammer that came down on her in 1998 when she fiddled with the concept — mean that although the play stays forever utterly faithful to its author, it also runs the risk of turning into a museum piece. Scripts just lie on a desk. Theater can’t stand so still. The actors assembled on the Lansburgh Theatre stage by Galway-based director Garry Hynes, a Tony winner in 1998 for her extraordinary handling of Martin McDonagh’s “The Beauty Queen of Leenane,” fulfill their assignments with elan. Those disheveled clowns out on the barren heath, Vladi­mir and Estragon, butts (like the rest of us) of a cosmic practical joke, are embodied here touchingly by Marty Rea (the taller one) and Aaron Monaghan (the needier one). Day after day after day, so the story goes, the bedraggled pair shows up for a promised meeting with unreliable Godot — often pronounced, as in this case, GOD-oh — only to be disappointed and told to come back tomorrow. What is it they’re waiting for? Redemption? Reward? An explanation? You can’t, it seems, count on anything in this life, even for someone to tell you why you’re living it. So Vladi­mir and Estragon cling to one another, alone together, seeing what turns up. What alternative do they have, in this tragedy tied up in the ridiculous, other than to go find that rope they keep threatening to retrieve, to hang themselves from that one sad tree, itself barely eking out an existence? It takes another pair of passersby, the effete Pozzo (Rory Nolan) and his cruelly used servant, Lucky (Garrett Lombard), to force Vladi­mir and Estragon to see some of the other ugly truths of the human condition. But the wisdom of the ages is lost on them; when Lucky goes into his astonishing sputtering monologue, launched by Pozzo’s command that he “Think!,” the words are spit out in such a frenetic jumble that the clowns can absorb nothing but the spectacle. The set by Francis O’Connor, a brown landscape of cracked earth framed by a sky of pockmarked granite, has that Beckett classic look of bleakness; only when lighting designer James F. Ingalls interrupts the aridity with the royal blues of nightfall does serenity momentarily and hypnotically transform the space. entertainment theater_dance        true Entertainment News Email Alerts Big stories in the entertainment world as they break.

Nolan makes for an aptly hammy Pozzo, figuratively and then literally blind to all the suffering he inflicts, and Lombard brings to the fore in Lucky’s pitiable countenance the victimized’s eternal tragic bearing. Hynes successfully steers her leading players to divergent and yet symbiotic characterizations. Rea’s performance is the metaphysical Abbott to Monaghan’s Costello. Or maybe it’s the other way around. In any event, they do uphold those Beckett standards of yore, these two physically agile comic actors, engaged in existential standup. That’s them, appearing at the Abyss, and they’ll be there all week, folks. Maybe a lot longer.  Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett. Directed by Garry Hynes.
