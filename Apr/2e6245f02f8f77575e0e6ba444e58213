The Concacaf Champions League finals is a two-leg affair, but for practical purposes, Toronto FC needed to hold its ground in the opener at chilly BMO Field on Tuesday. Instead, the reigning MLS Cup champions conceded the tiebreaking goal to Chivas Guadalajara on a free kick in the 72nd minute and lost, 2-1, to tumble into a perilous position entering the second leg next Wednesday in Mexico. With snow flurries swirling, Toronto goalkeeper Alex Bono misplayed Alan Pulido’s free kick from beyond the left side of the penalty area and let the high bid streak over him and into the far side netting. Compounding the defeat were the two away goals. Chivas will raise the trophy for the first time since 1962 with a victory, draw or 1-0 defeat in the return match. All is not lost for Toronto. In the previous two rounds against Mexican teams, it fared well in the second away leg. TFC scored two goals at Tigres in the second leg of the quarterfinals to gain the tiebreaking edge in a 4-4 aggregate draw. In the semifinals, a 1-1 deadlock at Club America in the second leg was enough to secure passage on 4-2 aggregate. Toronto is seeking to end Mexico’s grasp of the regional title for 13 consecutive years and become the first MLS side to win the Champions League since the current format was introduced 10 years ago. In that time, just three MLS teams have advanced to the finals. D.C. United (1998) and Los Angeles Galaxy (2000) are the only MLS representatives to win the crown since the league’s launch in 1996. The Concacaf winner will earn a berth in the FIFA Club World Cup in December in United Arab Emirates. Chivas went ahead on Rodolfo Pizarro’s goal in the second minute. Jonathan Osorio answered with his fourth tournament goal of the year by latching onto Marky Delgado’s cross to the back post in the 19th minute. Pizarro’s goal: Osorio’s goal: Pulido’s goal:
