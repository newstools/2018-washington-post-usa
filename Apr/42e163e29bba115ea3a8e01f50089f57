A new poll finds that 7 in 10 of Americans under age 30 who plan to vote in the midterm elections believe gun-control laws should be stricter, a reflection of growing support for such actions among younger Americans. The poll by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, conducted in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., finds that 64 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds favor stricter gun-control laws, regardless of whether they plan to vote in November. That is a 15 percentage point jump since 2013, months after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., when polling by the institute found that 49 percent of that group supported stricter laws. In the new poll, 10 percent said gun laws should be less strict, while 22 percent said they should be kept the same.

Other results have been previously released, including a finding that 37 percent said they will “definitely be voting” in the midterm elections, compared with 23 percent who said the same thing in a 2014 poll.
