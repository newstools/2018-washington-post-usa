Verne Troyer, an actor who was known best for his role as Mini-Me, a pint-size version of Mike Myers’s Dr. Evil in two “Austin Powers” movies, died April 21. He was 49. His family confirmed the death in a statement on the actor’s Instagram and Facebook pages. Other details were not immediately available. Mr. Troyer had reportedly been hospitalized earlier in the month in Los Angeles for alcohol abuse. Mr. Troyer, who was 2 foot 8, appeared in dozens of movies and TV series, including “Jack of All Trades” and “Boston Public.” His most famous role, by far, was as Mini-Me, first in “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” (1999) and in “Austin Powers in Goldmember” (2002). His character was a cloned version of Myers’s Dr. Evil, dressed in the same silver costume, with the same bald dome. In a variety of scenes, Mr. Troyer played the role with a subtle gift for humor and physical comedy, mimicking Myers’s hand gestures and echoing the faux-menace projected by Dr. Evil. Mr. Troyer was born Jan. 1, 1969, in Sturgis, Mich., and had a genetic disorder, achondroplasia dwarfism. He appeared as a stunt double in his first film, “Baby’s Day Out,” in 1994. He had minor roles in “Men in Black” (1997) and “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” (1998). In addition to his “Austin Powers” films, Mr. Troyer also appeared in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” (2001) as Griphook, a goblin, and in Myers’s 2008 film “The Love Guru.” Mr. Troyer was in several reality shows, including “Celebrity Juice,” “Celebrity Wife Swap,” and “The Surreal Life,” and had a YouTube channel. He had struggled with alcohol addiction and depression over the years and had spent time in rehabilitation facilities.
