The New York Knicks fired head coach Jeff Hornacek, multiple sources confirmed to The Washington Post. Hornacek was informed of the decision following a 110-98 road win over the Cleveland Cavaliers to close the regular season Thursday night. The loss brought New York’s record to 29-53, and left the Knicks with the ninth best odds in next month’s NBA Draft Lottery. The Knicks will announce the decision, which was first reported by ESPN, on Thursday morning. [ NBA playoff matchups: Who’s playing who in the East and West ] The decision to let Hornacek go is not a surprise. Hired two years ago by Phil Jackson to replace Derek Fisher, Hornacek was inherited by the new regime of team president Steve Mills and General Manager Scott Perry, and the expectation was that they would be inclined to bring in their own coach. Hornacek went 60-104 in his two seasons with the Knicks, and is 161-216 over four-plus seasons with the Knicks and Phoenix Suns. But between the dysfunction atop the organization over the first year he was in charge and losing Kristaps Porzingis to a torn anterior cruciate ligament this year, it’s fair to say Hornacek never got a fair shake in New York, either. Now begins the search for his replacement, with several familiar names expected to be in the mix – including former Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale and former Golden State Warriors coach Mark Jackson. Whoever gets the job should expect some leeway, given the team is clearly entering into a rebuild and will be without Porzingis for most of next season as he rehabilitates his knee injury.
