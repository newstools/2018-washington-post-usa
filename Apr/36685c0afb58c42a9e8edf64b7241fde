BOSTON — Baltimore Orioles right-hander Chris Tillman not only suffered his shortest outing of this young season Friday night at Fenway Park, but he appeared completely out of whack. Tillman lasted just three batters into the third inning, allowing 10 of the 16 batters he faced to reach base, giving up six runs on seven hits, two walks and a hit batter in the Orioles’ 7-3 loss. Perhaps worse than that pitching line was Tillman’s pitch chart, which displayed an incredible lack of command. As a result, the division-leading Red Sox improved to 11-2 while the Orioles lost for the third time in four games to slip to 5-9. It marked Tillman’s shortest outing since Aug. 3, when he also lasted two-plus innings and allowed seven runs (five earned) on six hits and two walks. He pitched mainly with his fastball Friday, never finding his feel for the pitch, and leading to some sharply hit balls by the Red Sox. Of the 13 pitches Boston batters put in play, four of them were hit with exit velocities of 104 mph or higher. In 57 pitches, Tillman induced just two swinging strikes. The most damaging hit off Tillman wasn’t a good one — Eduardo Nunez’s three-run homer over the Green Monster to put the Red Sox up 4-1 in the first inning had a hit percentage of just 49 percent. It came after Tillman issued a leadoff walk to Mookie Betts, a one-out single to Mitch Moreland, a sacrifice fly to J.D. Martinez and a double to Rafael Devers. — Baltimore Sun
