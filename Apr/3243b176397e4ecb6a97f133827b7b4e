The remains of three females have been found in the past few days at a site in Southeast Washington, authorities said Saturday. The skeletal remains were discovered in the 100 block of Wayne Place, said LaShon Beamon, spokeswoman for the D.C. office of the chief medical examiner. No ages or identities were provided, and no explanation was available for the presence of the remains. Nor was information available about when or how the deaths occurred. The matter is under investigation. The discovery appeared highly unusual. “It is out of the norm,” Beamon said. The first set of remains was discovered by construction workers Wednesday in a crawl space beneath an apartment house on Wayne Place, authorities said. Shortly afterward, Beamon said, authorities became aware that a second set of remains lay nearby. The first set of remains was completely removed Friday, and on Saturday, the city’s forensic anthropologist returned to the site to excavate the second. It was on Saturday, Beamon said, that the third set of remains was discovered. The site is a residential street near the city’s southern tip and is lined by two- or three-story apartment houses.
