In the city, the average first date of 80+ over the last 30 years ending in 2017 was April 2, so we should expect some 80s by now for most years. Of course, we hit 80+ in February, as well, one of the warmest days so early in the season on record. Since then it has been kind of chilly, though! For the entire month of April, the District tends to average about four days in the 80s or higher. Pollen update: It’s coming. Want our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox? Subscribe here.
