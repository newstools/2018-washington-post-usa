While new condos and apartments seem to spring up monthly in the District, finding a newly built single-family home in the city can be tougher. Buyers with deep pockets have a new option in Kent in Northwest, where Cabin John Builders recently completed an 8,000-square-foot mansion priced at $4.375 million. The three-level stucco-and-stone house at 2948 University Terrace NW has wood trim, a wood garage door and a copper roof over the front door. In the back, the house has a three-level turret with windows on every level adjacent to three levels of outdoor space. It has a balcony off the master suite, a screened-in porch with a stone fireplace off the family room and a covered patio on the lower level. [Ambassador’s residence in D.C.’s Kent lists for $7.35 million] Architectural details such as wood beams in the kitchen, a coffered ceiling in the family room and a breakfast area with a bay window add warmth to the house, along with four fireplaces. The master suite has a fireplace in the bedroom, a separate sitting room with glass doors to the balcony, and a luxurious marble bathroom with a free-standing soaking tub. The house has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. For a virtual tour and a 3-D tour, click here.
