Of course, he recommends a balanced diet. Sure, he eats veg-e-ta-bles. This makes us a little sad, but only until we review the selfies we took with him that day at the office. In the book itself, he is thoughtful in a way that will circle back to cookies — or any food that can be gobbled with furry hands, just as he is in his “life coach” sessions on YouTube. “Joy” has a first printing of 100,000, which is a monster number by any standards and especially for a first-time author who rarely uses articles such as “the.” You’ll find three recipes tucked in among the monster’s Cookie Truths and Cookie Crumbs of Wisdom.

(You can use a handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; beat on low speed.) Add the oat flour and oats, salt, baking soda and mini chocolate chips; stir until the chips are well distributed, to form a firm cookie dough. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 1 day. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners. Place 9 to 12 mounded tablespoon portions of dough on each baking sheet, spacing the portions at least 2 inches apart. Bake (upper and lower racks) for about 15 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and front to back halfway through. Let the cookies sit on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool. Repeat as needed to use all the dough. NOTE: To make your own oat flour, simply blitz old-fashioned rolled oats in a food processor until reduced to a powdery consistency. More from Food: Have questions about cooking?
