Q: Last year around this time there was a lot of talk about early-out and buyout offers. What happened? A: To avoid layoffs when downsizing or reorganizing, agencies may offer separation incentives — up to $40,000 at the Defense Department, up to $25,000 elsewhere — and/or may allow employees to retire earlier than under standard rules — at any age with at least 25 years of service or age 50 or later with at least 20 years. In the budget year ended last September, Office of Personnel Management figures show, 771 employees left via early retirement and 2,668 took buyouts, with some getting both. However, that is well below the averages of the previous five years of 2,204 and 7,138, respectively. The Defense Department, the government’s largest agency, consistently offers the most, although last summer the Environmental Protection Agency made a highly publicized round of offers that resulted in 98 employees retiring early and 374 getting buyouts. The expectations (or hopes) for a surge followed Trump administration proposals, which Congress had not acted on through last September, to severely restrict funding for many agencies. Last month, a budget agreement ultimately rejected most of those proposals, although the White House continues to seek many of them.
