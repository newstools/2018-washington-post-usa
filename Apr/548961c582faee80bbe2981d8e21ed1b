A search was underway Sunday afternoon for two teenagers thought to possibly be in an underground storm drain system in the Germantown area of Montgomery County, authorities said. The search was on streets that included Sceptre Ridge Terrace, Little Fox Lane, and Maryland Manor Court. County fire and rescue spokesman Pete Piringer said authorities were called by someone who had seen the teenagers, presumably near a drain entrance, and also heard voices that appeared to come from within a drain. Rescuers from the county fire and rescue service crawled through the drain in an effort to locate the youths. They used their own air supply and had lights. As of about 6:30 p.m., no one had been found, but Piringer said tracks had been spotted. The discovery prompted a further search in a new direction, Piringer said.
