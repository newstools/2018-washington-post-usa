Baritone Gerald Finley and pianist Julius Drake offered a concert Wednesday night at the Library of Congress that could have been a master class in how to communicate. Their program included early-19th-century settings of Goethe by Beethoven and Schubert, through Russian songs by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff to 20th-century English-language folk song settings by Copland, Barber, Respighi and Britten. Finley, a Canadian trained in Ottawa, Cambridge and London, is probably best known in this country as an opera singer. His rich baritone is in full blossom, with a commanding low voice, an enveloping midrange and a top that he wields with heart-stopping poignancy. Drake occupies a place similar to that held long ago by his fellow Briton, the late Gerald Moore, as one of the most sought-after collaborative pianists. But in contrast to the reserved Moore, Drake is an ever-present, dynamic partner. He and Finley have performed and recorded together for years. The clarity and power of their seasoned musicmaking was electric. Twenty-six songs made up their carefully conceived program, each selected for maximum contrast. Finley moved effortlessly between German, Russian and English, with an astonishing dynamic range, from stentorian declamation to whispered intimacy. The exquisite Schubert group, a series of deftly portrayed microcosms, was typical of the evening’s overall variety. The ballad-like “Prometheus” bristling with simmering resentment and defiance, was followed by the ethereal benediction of “Ghost Greetings” and “To the Moon,” sung with guileless simplicity. After a fervid “Restless Love” came a bitterly cynical “To Coachman Chronos.” Aching sadness and expressive economy characterized “Shepherd’s Lament” and “Wanderer’s Night Song II,” setting the stage for a hair-raising “Erl-King.” Finley’s and Drake’s bold performances raised this chilling Gothic tale to the level of existential horror. It brought the house down.
