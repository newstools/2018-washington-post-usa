Kanye West reaffirmed his affection for President Trump on Wednesday, calling him “my brother” and saying the two share “dragon energy.” West’s comments on Twitter came amid renewed attention on social media and elsewhere in recent days about the rapper’s feelings about the president. During the presidential transition, West made a high-profile trip to Trump Tower a couple of weeks after he was met with a chorus of boos at a concert in San Jose when he shared that he would have voted for Trump — had he voted. West has more recently mused about running for president himself in 2020. A radio personality who said he had spoken to West told listeners Monday that West remains fond of Trump, relaying that West told him, “I do love Donald Trump.” On Wednesday, West spoke out on the subject, writing on Twitter that “you don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him.” You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. “We are both dragon energy,” West wrote. “He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.” In a later tweet, West explained that his wife, Kim Kardashian, had suggested that he “make this clear to everyone.” my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself. “I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself,” West said in the tweet. Asked about West at Wednesday’s daily briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that she wasn’t aware of any conversations between West and the president since their Trump Tower meeting. “I don’t know of any conservation they’ve had over the past week or so,” she said. But Trump liked West's tweets and responded later Wednesday.

Owens has appeared on both Infowars and Fox News Channel to promote her view that media outlets have brainwashed black people to vote for Democrats.
