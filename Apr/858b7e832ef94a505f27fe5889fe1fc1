Bad at goodbyes? This Arizona highway patrolman knows how you feel. Mark Gilberg served as a state trooper with the Arizona Department of Public Safety for 37 years. He retired March 28 — but first, he made an emotional radio call to his colleagues. His tearful goodbye was recorded on video and posted to YouTube by his daughter. “Badge 2988 began his career March 11th, 1981. This will be my final 10-7,” Gilberg said. 10-7 means signing off-duty. The dispatcher on the other side of the call responded, “10-4, and you’re making me cry too.
