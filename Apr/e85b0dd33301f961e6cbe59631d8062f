The NFL season will open Sept. 6 with the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Atlanta Falcons, whom they beat in the NFC divisional round last season. The opening weekend features several other intriguing matchups, including Jon Gruden returning to the coaching ranks in a Monday night game between the Oakland Raiders and Los Angeles Rams. And the three Thanksgiving games will include three divisional showdowns: the Chicago Bears at the Detroit Lions, the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys and the Atlanta Falcons at the New Orleans Saints. Those were among the highlights of the NFL’s Thursday night schedule reveal, an event that has somehow become yet another landmark of the league’s 365-day calendar. The NFL is also moving up kickoff time for prime-time games, in a move that will delight East Coasters and irritate West Coasters. “Monday Night Football” will start at 8:15 p.m. (15 minutes earlier); “Sunday Night Football” will kick off at 8:20 (10 minutes earlier); and “Thursday Night Football” will begin at 8:20 (five minutes earlier). Here’s a look at each team’s schedule, plus one game we’re most looking forward to for every team. But first, a look at some of the schedule’s most intriguing games. Falcons at Eagles, Sept. 6: The Eagles begin a defense of their Super Bowl title in the NFL’s season-opening game. Will it be with Carson Wentz back at quarterback or with reigning Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles still filling in? 49ers at Vikings, Sept. 9: The Vikings made Kirk Cousins the NFL’s highest-paid player by signing the free agent quarterback to a guaranteed three-year, $84 million contract. Cousins’s first game comes against the Niners and Jimmy Garoppolo, who signed a five-year, $137.5 million deal before free agency to remain in San Francisco. Texans at Patriots, Sept. 9: Deshaun Watson probably would have been the NFL’s offensive rookie of the year last season if his season hadn’t ended early. He returns to try to pick up where he left off. Bengals at Colts, Sept. 9: Andrew Luck once was going to be the NFL’s next big thing at quarterback. Will he be back in the lineup on Opening Day and, if so, will he once more resemble a franchise quarterback? Patriots at Jaguars, Sept. 16: The rematch of last season’s AFC title game comes in Week 2 in Jacksonville. Chargers at Rams, Sept. 23: The “Fight for L.A.” becomes more than a Chargers’ marketing slogan. Vikings at Eagles, Oct. 7: Cousins returns to a familiar NFC East site in a high-profile matchup of prospective conference favorites. Eagles vs. Jaguars in London, Oct. 28: They were two of the league’s most surprising success stories last season. Everyone will be waiting to see what each can do for an encore. The NFL gives fans in London a matchup of very attractive teams. Saints at Vikings, Oct. 28: The two teams that produced one of the most memorable endings ever to an NFL playoff game get back together, this time in a Sunday night game. Raiders at Niners, Nov. 1: The offseason roster retooling by the 49ers, with the re-signing of Garoppolo and the arrival of Richard Sherman, and the hiring of Jon Gruden as the Raiders’ coach provide some intrigue to this Thursday night meeting of the Bay Area’s teams. Rams at Saints, Nov. 4: They were the two NFC front-runners that failed to reach the conference championship game last season. There are plenty of reasons to believe they could be back in the Super Bowl chase this season given the Rams’ big offseason moves and Drew Brees’s decision to remain in New Orleans. Packers at Patriots, Nov. 4: Aaron Rodgers vs. Tom Brady. Appreciate it while they’re both still at (or near) the tops of their games. Steelers at Jaguars, Nov. 18: The Jaguars ousted the Steelers from last season’s AFC playoffs. The Steelers get their chance at a small measure of regular season payback. Vikings at Patriots, Dec. 2: The Vikings added Cousins as the potential final piece to a Super Bowl puzzle. If they actually do get there, perhaps the Patriots would be waiting for them. Eagles at Rams, Dec. 16: It’s Wentz vs. Jared Goff as two potential NFC heavyweights square off. Patriots at Steelers, Dec. 16: The NFL’s new catch rule means that, this time, the Jesse James play would have been a catch and a touchdown. That comes a bit late for the Steelers.

But Eli Manning did have his two biggest days of the 2017 season against the Eagles (passing for 366 and 434 yards). Their first meeting comes on the second Thursday of October.

Aaron Rodgers figures to be healthy and he did not hide his disgust for the tackle by Anthony Barr that left him with a broken collarbone and derailed what looked like it might have been an MVP season last October. Detroit Lions Sept. 10 vs. New York Jets (Mon), 7:10 p.m. (ESPN) Sept. 16 at San Francisco 49ers, 4:05 p.m. (FOX) Sept. 23 vs. New England Patriots, 8:20 p.m. (NBC) Sept. 30 at Dallas Cowboys, 1 p.m. (FOX) Oct. 7 vs. Green Bay Packers, 1 p.m. (FOX) Oct. 14 — BYE Oct. 21 at Miami Dolphins, 1 p.m. (FOX) Oct. 28 vs. Seattle Seahawks, 1 p.m. (FOX) Nov. 4 at Minnesota Vikings, 1 p.m. (FOX) Nov. 11 at Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. (FOX) Nov. 18 vs. Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m. (FOX) Nov. 22 vs. Chicago Bears (Thanksgiving), 12:30 p.m. (CBS) Dec. 2 vs. Los Angeles Rams, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 9 at Arizona Cardinals, 4:05 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 16 at Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 23 vs. Minnesota Vikings, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 30 at Green Bay Packers, 1 p.m. (FOX) Game we can’t wait for: The questions don’t so much surround the Lions’ offense as they do the team’s defense. What will Matt Patricia, the team’s new head coach, do with this group? Let’s see how the gang fares against New England, where Patricia formerly served as defensive coordinator. They play on Sept. 23, a Sunday night. Green Bay Packers Sept. 9 vs. Chicago Bears, 8:20 p.m. (NBC) Sept. 16 vs. Minnesota Vikings, 1 p.m. (FOX) Sept. 23 at Washington Redskins, 1 p.m. (FOX) Sept. 30 vs. Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m. (CBS) Oct. 7 at Detroit Lions, 1 p.m. (FOX) Oct. 15 vs. San Francisco 49ers, 8:15 p.m. (ESPN) Oct. 21 — BYE Oct. 28 at Los Angeles Rams, 4:25 p.m. (FOX) Nov. 4 at New England Patriots, 8:20 p.m. (NBC) Nov. 11 vs. Miami Dolphins, 1 p.m. (CBS) Nov. 15 at Seattle Seahawks, 8:20 p.m. (FOX/NFLN) Nov. 25 at Minnesota Vikings, 8:20 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 2 vs. Arizona Cardinals, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 9 vs. Atlanta Falcons, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 16 at Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 23 at New York Jets, 1 p.m. (FOX) Dec. 30 vs. Detroit Lions, 1 p.m. (FOX) Game we can’t wait for: Rams vs. Packers in L.A.?

In that unforgettable playoff game, Drew Brees had a classic second half, completing 17 of 22 passes for 177 yards with three touchdowns. But the Saints’ season ended in a heartbreaking 29-24 loss that came on Stefon Diggs’s fantastic buzzer-beater touchdown.
