TORONTO — The Washington Wizards are letting their Eastern Conference playoff series against the Toronto Raptors slip away in the same manner with which they treated an important loose ball on Tuesday. In the fourth quarter, when the Wizards needed to sustain a semblance of hustle and heart, point guard John Wall tossed a lob pass to power forward Markieff Morris. But the pass did not find his 6-foot-10 teammate and instead the Raptors’ 6-foot-5 Delon Wright swatted it away. While all-star Bradley Beal watched the ball nearly roll out of bounds, Toronto’s all-star DeMar DeRozan gave chase. DeRozan saved the possession to Kyle Lowry, who found the streaking Wright for the emphatic finish. It was just one play in the Raptors’ 130-119 win over the Wizards in Game 2, but a significant explanation for why Washington has fallen into a two-game hole in the series. The Wizards’ defense failed them once again as the Raptors notched a franchise playoff record for points in a game and DeRozan tied his postseason career high with 37 points. Washington nearly overcame a 23-point deficit, and got 63 points from the bench, but the night still turned to ashes. Mike Scott led the reserves unit with 20 points, including 4-of-5 shooting from the arc. Ty Lawson, making his Wizards debut, hit four three-pointers and rang up 14 points and eight assists. As a team, the Wizards made 10 of 22 from beyond the arc but still didn’t match the sizzling shooting of the Raptors. Since Saturday night, when the Raptors glided to a Game 1 win off the strength of 16 made three-pointers, the Wizards spent two off-days making adjustments and promising change. But playing more desperate? No, Wall responded when a reporter questioned if the Wizards needed more urgency ahead of Game 2. “Just coming out being more focused on the defensive end,” Wall said, offering a practical solution. But the Wizards’ attention to detail vanished as soon as the Raptors executed their game plan from the weekend. When a Raptor — any player, including a big like Serge Ibaka — made a penetrating move to the basket, several Washington defenders merely chased the ball like a pet hypnotized by a chew toy. Instead of paying attention to the real threat moving into position beyond the arc, the Wizards followed the shiny thing until Toronto moved the ball to the open shooter. In the opening quarter, Washington inexcusably surrendered three long-range shots from the same corner area in front of the Raptors’ bench. While the corner troubled the Wizards, Beal had his own difficulty in defending around the arc. Beal produced a minus-28 through the half largely due to his late closeout mistakes. While the Wizards trailed 12-4 early in the opening quarter, he fouled rookie OG Anunoby on a three-point attempt. Later in the quarter, Beal clocked DeRozan while shooting beyond the arc and gave up a four-point possession. The play, and a host of other poor defensive decisions, led to the Wizards’ worst quarter of the season as Toronto scored an opponent-high 44 points. When Beal returned to the floor in the second quarter, he continued to make defensive blunders. With 1:56 remaining in the half, Beal tried to contest center Jonas Valanciunas but instead picked up his third shooting foul. Beal knew the whistle was coming and walked the length of the court to the Wizards sideline without saying a word. But once he found his seat, Beal yelled an expletive to himself — summing up the feelings of the Wizards’ faithful who watched their team give up 76 points and fall into a 23-point deficit in the first half. Washington nearly salvaged the night with a strong push after halftime. In the third quarter, the Wizards scored 32 points. Then, with 7:52 remaining in the final quarter, Wall made a pair of free throws to trim the lead to 108-103. The Raptors responded by scoring seven straight. Beal finished 3 for 11 from the field for nine points, while Wall finished with 29 points and made all 11 of his free throws. — Candace Buckner Game 1 recap and biggest moments: *Toronto wins 130-119 to flip the script on Washington: The Raptors took a 2-0 lead Tuesday night as the series heads to Washington, where the Wizards hope to avoid a sweep — which is exactly what happened the last time these two met in the playoffs. Back in 2015 it was Washington who swept the opening round 4-0. Bradley Beal will finish tonight with a -34 plus-minus, the worst by any Wizards player in the last 20 postseasons. Next 2 are in our house.

And, in doing so, he’s gotten the Wizards back into a game that looked over. Well, that and John Wall being ridiculous, anyway. What once was a 22-point lead has been cut to, at one point, five in the fourth quarter of Game 2 in Toronto, and currently sits at 113-103 with seven minutes remaining. But even if Washington fails to complete this comeback — and the most likely outcome is that they do come up short — expect the Wizards to remain small moving forward in this series. It’s given Wall so many more lanes to operate, and the difference has been notable. *If you didn’t already know the bench was carrying this game: Mike Scott has 20 points in 22 minutes. He’s doing well in Scott Brooks’s small lineup. Mike Scott and Ty Lawson are a combined 8-for-10 from three-point range. *The Wizards are trying to work things out: We knew going into this opening round that Washington didn’t exactly have its identity solidified. They’re working on it. Look at Bradley Beal while Wall and Gortat argue lollll pic.twitter.com/91nGZ06xd8 More beef here: Drake just called Kelly Oubre Jr. a bum as he ran by 👀 pic.twitter.com/8b9MLJ0mpU And yet … four minutes into the fourth quarter, they’ve narrowed it to a five-point game, courtesy of an 8-0 run. It was once a 23-point deficit. Toronto answered with a 17-4 run. *AFTER THREE QUARTERS: It’s a 10-point game: Washington used an 8-2 run to end the third with a much smaller deficit, outscoring Toronto 32-24 in the frame. John Wall came alive for 14 points in the third quarter. Can the Wizards get even closer? Strong third quarter for the #Wizards ... scoring 32 and pulling to within 100-90.John Wall up to 21 pointsTy Lawson has been a revelation off the bench: 9 pts 8 assts *Here’s a bright spot: John Wall isn’t 6-for-20 from the floor: He’s 6-for-12 for 15 points and having a quietly solid shooting night, in part because the Raptors showed in Game 1 that they’re content to slack off Wall and key in on the other shooters. But to say Wall can’t do it alone is a major understatement. *Bradley Beal picks up his fourth foul midway through the third quarter: It gets worse: Beal picks up his 4th foul with 8:13 left in Q3, his 3rd foul defending a 3-pointer. #WizRaptors The Wizards started the third quarter with a nice 7-0 run. Then that vanished. Otto Porter with the fastbreak slam. Wizards are starting to build some momentum early in the second half.LIVE STREAM: https://t.co/Uvk3ibqA3C pic.twitter.com/WnSoIAkfxI *HALFTIME: Raptors 76, Wizards 58: The Wizards were led by Mike Scott with 14 points off the bench, and John Wall and Bradley Beal combined for 13 points. Washington’s defense allowed the Raptors to shoot 56 percent from the field for the half, including 50 percent from the three-point line (11-for-22) as DeMar DeRozan unloaded a team-high 20 points. 76 is tied for the second most points the Wizards have given up in a half this season. #Wizards starters:Otto Porter Jr. -14Markieff Morris -25Marcin Gortat -9Bradley Beal -28John Wall -15 Ian Mahinmi is +4 though https://t.co/766eNqyaMZ * Tim Bontemps’s take: Those questions about the Toronto Raptors finally being able to carry over their regular season form to the playoffs? Yeah, those have been answered. And then some. Toronto leads Washington 76-58 at halftime, and it’s hard to see how the Raptors won’t go on to secure a 2-0 lead in their first round series against the Wizards. This has been a truly comprehensive performance, destroying the Wizards from start to finish and erasing all doubts about whether they’d be able to carry over the best regular season in franchise history to the postseason. The question now is whether Washington can do something to change the course of this game after an embarrassing first half display. *It’s getting even messier at Air Canada Centre: Some folks in their courtside seats spilled a bunch of beer and soda. Alright guys, it’s not that bad. We have a, uh, beer delay? pic.twitter.com/66wSF3QVTz This is messy, too. DRAKE CHIRPING JOHN WALL "YOU'RE GETTING BODIED BY 20 TONIGHT" pic.twitter.com/96NjDZ5mlI *Three the North: The Raptors have hit 11 threes in the first half. Yikes. As the Wizards’ defense continues to struggle, the Raptors continue their three-point blitz. That's more 3s than the Raptors had in eight of their 10 playoff games last season (and more attempts than two playoff games, amazingly). https://t.co/IJhFt7eW7f the Raptors are 11-for-19 from three. there's six minutes left in the half. The #Raptors have matched their playoff record for a half (either half) and there's still 4:52 seconds of punishment remaining.Gulp. *The legend of Ty Lawson: Lawson, in his Wizards debut, is their best player so far in Game 2. Fresh from China, Lawson has eight assists in 12 first-half minutes. John Wall and Bradley Beal are pinned to the bench with two fouls apiece. Ty Lawson's 8 assists are already tied for the most by a player off the bench in the playoffs in the last two years. It's the most this year. * The Raptors have never won the first two games to open a playoff series: But they are well on their way tonight! The @Raptors franchise record for points in a quarter is 39. They have 37 with 2:20 left in the 1st.#WeTheNorth #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/czpNbb2cpD *Let’s review this late first-quarter lineup: Kelly Oubre Jr., Mike Scott, Ty Lawson, Tomas Satoransky and Ian Mahinmi matched up against Toronto’s starters to end the first quarter. That’s all. After one, it’s 44-27. This is the most points the Wizards/Bullets franchise has allowed in a postseason quarter since 1965 (46 vs. St. Louis Hawks). Wizards down double digits, Raptors have 44 points in the first quarter and Wall and Beal each with 2 fouls. pic.twitter.com/Y7ZqbTDGwa *Ty Lawson made a three! Everything else is bad: REBOUNDS: 13-3 Toronto. FIELD GOAL PERCENTAGE: Toronto 62.5, Washington 37.5. THREE POINTERS: Toronto 4, Washington 1. SCORE: 28-13 with 4:20 left in the first. In the first seven minutes of Raptors-Wizards we have seen: — John Wall pick up two fouls — Ty Lawson, fresh off a stint in China, checking into the game — Marcin Gortat being turned into a traffic cone — Mike Scott checking into the game for him — Four different Raptors hitting three-pointers, and going 4-for-5 from three overall. That’s how a team that desperately needs to win Game 2 after losing Game 1 finds itself trailing by 15 points in the first eight minutes. This could get ugly in a hurry for Washington — and the Wizards could see this series, and their season, all but end along with it. *Feeling shaky about the Wizards’ chances? Here are two good, probably inconsequential stats to help. John Wall and Bradley Beal have never lost a Game 2 of an opening playoff round when they’re both available to play. Also, the Wizards and Capitals (who play tonight in Columbus) have won playoff games on the same day twice. Both times, the Air Canada Centre was involved — in 2015, when the Wizards beat the Raptors and last year when the Capitals beat the Maple Leafs. Good luck, eh? [Caps, Nats and Wizards could pull off a D.C. sports trifecta (or a cry-fecta)] *Fred VanVleet is available tonight. What does that mean for the Wizards? Backup point guard Fred VanVleet is available to play tonight after sitting out Game 1 with shoulder soreness. The second-year pro has been a pretty efficient shooter for Toronto especially in the second half of the season, but Raptors Coach Dwane Casey said in his news conference yesterday that the real difference VanVleet makes is that he opens the floor with his three-point shot. VanVleet shot 44 percent from beyond the arc in the second half of the season, and the Wizards really don’t need another good perimeter shooter to deal with in Game 2 — the Raptors had 16 three’s on Saturday Previous series results Game 1: at Raptors 114, Wizards 106 Remaining schedule Game 3: Friday at Washington, 8 p.m., NBCSW and ESPN2 Game 4: Sunday at Washington, 6 p.m., NBCSW and TNT Game 5 (if necessary): Wednesday, April 25, at Toronto, time TBD, NBCSW Game 6 (if necessary): Friday, April 27, at Washington, time TBD, NBCSW Game 7 (if necessary): Sunday, April 29, at Toronto, time and television TBD [Caps, Nats and Wizards could pull off a D.C. sports trifecta (or a D.C. sports cry-fecta)] Additional reading >> Any way you judge the Wizards — with or without John Wall, at their best or worst, home or road, bickering or harmonious, big game or run-of-the-mill affair — they do one thing with stunning consistency: Flub the fourth quarter. They close games like they are trying to slam the heaviest door ever made. If they don’t summon more late-game strength, their season of what ifs and not quites will end with a few last “We had ’em, but . . . ” regrets, writes Jerry Brewer. >> John Wall thought he was “fat” when the season opened. During this two-month layoff to rehab from knee surgery, Wall and his personal remolded his diet and body. He’s dropped almost 15 pounds, enabling him to play lighter on his feet. Here’s how that diet looks. Speaking of Wall, Tom Boswell thinks the Wizards star needs to shoot a whole lot less. >> Ty Lawson, who agreed Friday to a deal with the Wizards for the rest of the season, did not play in Game 1 against the Toronto Raptors, but he has more postseason experience over the past two weeks than anyone in this series. Still, it’s unclear whether Lawson will actually see minutes. >> The Raptors and Wizards are such comparable peers. They’ve both been building toward their current rosters since 2010. They both broke through to the playoffs in 2014. But after the Wizards swept the Raptors in the 2015 playoffs, Toronto made the conference final the next season while Washington still hasn’t advanced beyond the second round. So while the Wizards and Raptors once had similar trajectories, now Toronto has clearly surged ahead, writes Jerry Brewer. sports  washington-wizards Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Sports Daily newsletter Sports news with a focus on D.C. area teams.

But Kelly Oubre Jr. often draws the ire of his coach because he flashes so much skill on the defensive end but negates the potential with youthful miscues. He played 10 fewer minutes than his season average in Saturday’s game as a result. >> The top of the Wizards’ roster might be a little better than the Raptors’ best players. On Saturday night, however, the Raptors sent a strong initial message about who they are during a 114-106 victory in Game 1 at Air Canada Centre. In short, they’re better — clearly better — than Washington, writes Jerry Brewer. These aren’t two teams striding alongside each other on the same journey. The Raptors have pulled ahead, and if you’re expecting them to slow down so the Wizards can catch up, that’s not how this is going to go.
