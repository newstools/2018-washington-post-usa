The surveillance video photo shows a person getting out of a dark-colored vehicle — another possible lead in a string of attacks to disable speed cameras around Washington. In one of the latest incidents, D.C. police said a “person and vehicle of interest” were seen on a surveillance camera around 1 a.m. April 12 in the 3700 block of Southern Avenue SE near the Maryland and District line and Suitland Road.  Another incident happened April 19 involving a camera in the same area of Southern Avenue SE, according to police. In that case, a nearby surveillance camera showed a dark-colored pickup truck pulling up to the area and then backing up to ram and knock over a speed camera. In February, there were similar incidents that involved several speed cameras in Northeast Washington. [Vandals damage nearly one dozen District speed cameras] Eleven speed cameras were vandalized, police said. In one of the February incidents, surveillance photos showed a man walking by a sedan or small SUV near the southbound side of the Anacostia Freeway, just south of Eastern Avenue in the 800 block of Ridge Road SE. D.C. police have said that one camera in February was pushed over and ripped off its mounting. In another case, the camera was missing. Authorities said they are “investigating the possibility” of whether the most recent case and the February incidents are related. Speed cameras have gained popularity among transportation and safety officials and police departments to make drivers slow down. But many drivers loathe receiving tickets from them.
