Former FBI director James B. Comey is pushing back against President Trump’s suggestion that he should be jailed, saying in a new interview that Trump’s pronouncements on Twitter pose a “great danger.” “This is not some tin-pot dictatorship where the leader of the country gets to say, ‘The people I don't like go to jail,’” Comey told NPR in the latest in a series of interviews to promote his new book. In tweets Sunday and Monday, Trump alleged, without citing evidence, that Comey had committed “many crimes” and deserves to be jail for leaking classified information and lying to Congress — allegations Comey denies.

Trump has tweeted more a half-dozen times about Comey in recent days, including a retweet Monday night of a post promoting a new RNC website that refers to “Lyin’ Comey.”
