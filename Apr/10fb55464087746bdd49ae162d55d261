TBS’s comedy “The Last O.G.” (premiering Tuesday) stars Tracy Morgan, the beloved “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock” alum who was nearly killed in a 2014 turnpike pileup and then recovered and worked his way back to optimal career speed. The show is co-created by Jordan Peele, who recently won a screenwriting Oscar for his wildly entertaining and culturally prescient horror film “Get Out.” Finally, it co-stars Tiffany Haddish, a gifted actress and comedian (“Girls Trip”) who shot to fame last summer and enveloped the world in her own giddy Haddishosphere. The combination of these names (Morgan, Peele, Haddish) will certainly arouse the search engines, but “The Last O.G.,” which was originally set to debut last fall, lacks the impact and/or the consistent laughs that a viewer might expect. Just beneath its easy jokes, however, it reveals a sweeter theme about a man who just wants a second chance to do right by those he loves most. Morgan stars as Tray, a freshly paroled Brooklyn drug dealer who spent the past 15 years in the clink. Upon release, he returns to his home turf to find it shockingly gentrified with the usual telltale signs of Stuff White People Like: luxury baby strollers, high-end boutiques and expensive restaurants overrun by foodies. Tray’s former girlfriend Shay (Haddish), made the most of the upgrade. She finished college and runs a successful nonprofit charity. She also married an earnest white man, Josh (Ryan Gaul), with whom she’s raising her twin son and daughter, Shahzad (Dante Hoagland) and Amira (Taylor Mosby). Tray tracks down Shay at a fundraising cocktail party, where he also sees the teenagers and realizes that he is their father. Shay, who cut off contact after Tray went to jail, sternly asks Tray to stay out of their lives. (It’s a good — but far from great — role for Haddish, who joined the cast before her career mushroomed. The show barely showcases her talents.) But here is where “The Last O.G.” makes strong use of Morgan’s knack for playing hilariously sensitive yet determinedly delusional men. Rather than bemoan his existence as an ex-con who lives with other parolees in a halfway house lorded over by a hapless disciplinarian (Cedric the Entertainer), Tray sets about adapting to this strange new world and finding a way to show Shay that he is worthy to be included in his kids’ lives. Tray, who was lauded by inmates for his contraband cooking skills in prison, offers his culinary services at a hip restaurant, which promptly rejects him — but not before stealing his recipe for a vending-machine candy dessert loaf. Tray finds better luck working at a chain coffee shop, which is owned by Wavy (Malik Yoba), a former drug dealer from Tray’s past life who found a more lucrative career supplying Brooklyn’s caffeine addicts. Though his world is now filled with uninviting signifiers of wealth and exclusivity, Tray is such a sympathetic, well-intentioned character that this same world cannot help but try to give him a little boost. Whether it's his younger cousin Bobby (Allen Maldonado), who helps Tray learn to adjust, or the lovable bunch of ex-cons who live in the halfway house, there seems to be a number of people in Tray’s life who want to see him succeed. In a later episode, there’s also a jilted jailhouse girlfriend named Pooh Cat (played with trashy-mouthed ferocity by “This Is Us’s” Chrissy Metz), who discovers on visitation day that Tray has left prison without telling her. She’s now dead-set on finding him and making him keep the promises he made. entertainment tv        true   Please provide a valid email address. As far as it goes, “The Last O.G.” is a mildly enjoyable half-hour. Its first six episodes are packed too heavily with plot and too easily move past the real attraction, which is watching Tray wander around Brooklyn in a state of cultural bewilderment. Not only do these scenes make for the show’s funniest moments, but they also seem to get at “The Last O.G.’s” real concern: When a neighborhood changes this much, it tramples over someone’s past, as well as their vital sense of belonging.  The Last O.G. (30 minutes) premieres Tuesday at 10:30 p.m. on TBS.
