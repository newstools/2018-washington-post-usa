Jordan Spieth, Thursday’s Masters leader after a brilliant opening round, stumbled immediately Friday with a double bogey on the opening hole followed by a bogey on the second. That dropped him out of the lead, which was at least temporarily taken over by Matt Kuchar and Rory McIlroy. Spieth’s errant start was particularly surprising given his history on Masters Fridays. In his four previous Masters appearances, he was a combined 9 under par in the second round, with only one over-par round. He teed off shortly before 11 a.m. Eastern Friday in a group with Alex Noren and Louis Oosthuizen, still holding a two-shot lead and seeking to win his second Masters. He had seemed ready to run away from the field late Thursday, but a bogey on No. 18 coupled with Friday’s rocky opening changed those thoughts. Spieth wasn’t the only golfer to face trouble in the early going Friday. At one point Friday morning, of 36 players on the course, only Webb Simpson had managed to be under par. Others joined Simpson under par as Friday’s round continued. Three-time winner Phil Mickelson birded the second hole but gave the shot back with a bogey on No. 4. McIlroy, needing a Masters win to complete a career Grand Slam, opened his round bogey-birdie-birdie to tie Kuchar at 4 under par. Kuchar parred his first four holes Friday. Finau falls back Tony Finau, author of the strangest Masters story line this week, also stumbled early Friday, bogeying the opening hole and No. 6 to drop to 2 under par for the tournament. The 28-year old Masters rookie from Utah had badly rolled his ankle in Wednesday’s par-3 contest, suffering a high ankle sprain that seemed to put his Masters prospects in jeopardy. But he managed a round of 4-under 68 on Thursday, putting him in a tie for second with fellow American Kuchar, two shots behind Spieth. “When I woke up this morning, nothing short of a miracle, if you ask me,” Finau said Thursday. “I could barely put any pressure on [the ankle]. I could barely walk.” Finau was among the first of the Masters leaders to tee off Friday, and he bogeyed the first hole for the second day in a row. Spieth sets the pace One round into the Masters, the tournament already feels like it’s Jordan Spieth’s to lose. The 24-year-old past Masters champion and three-time major winner singed the course Thursday afternoon, reeling off five straight birdies on the back nine to take a two-shot lead. His Augusta history makes that performance even more impressive. In his first three Masters appearances, as The Post’s Barry Svlurga noted during Thursday’s coverage, Spieth finished second, first and second. He has played 17 career rounds in the Masters. He has led alone or shared the lead after nine of them. That equals the number of Masters rounds Tiger Woods has led — and Woods has played this event 20 times. Spieth is appearing in just his fifth Masters. This is the 9th round of his career that Jordan Spieth has held the lead or a share at #TheMasters. That ties Tiger Woods' career total. pic.twitter.com/xDH0q9tyhP “We build plans for the year to peak at certain times,” Spieth said after finishing the first round at 6 under par. “And I believe that not just here at Augusta, but the major championships going back a number of years, I’ve played really well.” [ Boswell: Tiger Woods was back at the Masters, and golf just might have plenty more of him ] Then consider the recent history of this tournament. The last 12 Masters winners were under par and in the top 10 after the first round, according to ESPN. That’s bad news for a host of big names, including Justin Rose (tied for 21st, even par), Bubba Watson and Dustin Johnson (both tied for 29th, 1 over), Justin Thomas (tied for 42nd, 2 over), Jason Day (tied for 55th, 3 over) and Woods himself, who finished the first round of his Masters comeback seven shots back after a 1-over 73. The last time the Masters winner wasn’t under par and in the top 10 after the first round was 2005, when Woods rallied from 2 over and a tie for 33rd to claim his fourth and most recent green jacket. So who else finished in Thursday’s top 10? After Finau and Kuchar, there’s a seven-way tie at 3 under, three shots behind Spieth’s mark. That group includes a pair of Americans — Charley Hoffman and Patrick Reed, the latter of whom sparred with Spieth at a recent match-play event. There’s also a grab bag of international players: Sweden’s Henrik Stenson, Canadian Adam Hadwin, China’s Li Haotong, Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Rory McIlroy, other than Spieth the biggest name in the top 10. McIlroy, needing a Masters win to complete the career Grand Slam, birdied three of Augusta’s four par 5s in his opening round and had just a single bogey. More stars lurk just outside the top 10, including three-time champ Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, still looking for his first major. But it’s hard to imagine Spieth won’t be the focus on Friday. “If you get off to a good start,” Spieth said, “you’re in control of your own fate, versus needing some help.” [ Live Masters leaderboard ] How to watch (all times Eastern) Tee times (all times Eastern) Woods, who began in the morning on Thursday, will tee off in one of Friday’s final groups at 1:27 p.m. Mickelson, Fowler and Kuchar began play together around 10:30 a.m., with McIlroy, Spieth, Rose and Johnson among the other favorites who teed off before noon. The full list of tee times for Friday is here, along with breakdowns of the top groups. Sergio’s disaster Defending champion Sergio Garcia saw his chances of repeating disappear on the back nine Thursday when he melted down at the par-5 15th. He arrived there 2 over for the day and had eagled the hole in his final round last year. The 15th is historically the course’s easiest hole. But Garcia put five balls in the water and carded a 13, two shots higher than anyone had ever recorded at the 15th. “You saw it,” Garcia said. “I don’t think I need to describe it.” But on Friday morning, Garcia seemed to see the humor in it all while responding on Twitter to the Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, who posited that Garcia and his wife won’t be naming their next child Firethorn, after Augusta National’s name for the 15th hole. Garcia’s first child, born last month, was named Azalea after the 13th hole at Augusta, where he began his charge to the green jacket last year. What happened on 15 @TheMasters yesterday was unfortunate for me and it hurt but I tried to handle it like a Masters Champion should. That same hole gave me that green jacket last year so we might end up naming our next kid Firethorn after all, funny man!😉 https://t.co/vMIDTMGhrf Read Barry Svrluga’s full report about Garcia’s nightmare. Sergio García hit 5 balls in the water on the 15th hole, making a 13, which matches the highest score on any hole in #TheMasters history. His round of 81 (+9) is the worst opening round by a defending champion in Masters history. pic.twitter.com/R3hAeNGxzZ Weather report It will remain sunny Friday and should be about 10 degrees warmer than Thursday’s high 60s, though the winds will pick up a bit. Saturday’s third round is a big question mark, however, with rain and continued breeziness in the forecast. Whether it will be enough to halt play remains to be seen, but it very well could (especially if any thunderstorms pop up). The wet weather should help soften Augusta’s notoriously tricky greens. Mostly sunny skies will return Sunday, though it will be cool with highs in the mid-60s.
