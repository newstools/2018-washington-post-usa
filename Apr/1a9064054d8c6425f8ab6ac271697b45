Four people were injured when a house in Texas exploded after it was struck by a car. The incident unfolded Saturday in the city of Hurst and was captured on a home surveillance camera. Police in Hurst said a vehicle crashed into a home on Myrtle Drive. As officers were talking to the driver, the house exploded. The driver of the vehicle was not hurt and two officers suffered minor injuries. One was taken to a hospital for evaluation. After the explosion, police said in a statement they could hear screams coming from the house. They got in through a back door and found three people inside who had been injured. They were transported to hospitals for their injuries, according to police. The extent of their injuries was not confirmed by authorities. The cause of the crash and explosion are under investigation. According to NBC 5 in Dallas-Fort Worth, officials said the vehicle may have struck a gas line — a possible cause of the explosion.
