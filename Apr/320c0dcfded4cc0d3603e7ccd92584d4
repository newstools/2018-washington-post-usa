Don’t be worried if your cellphone starts to buzz loudly on Thursday morning. It is only a test. The District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency, along with about 20 other area jurisdictions, is doing a test message at the same time on Thursday between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. for the “wireless emergency alert (WEA) system.” This system is a way to alert residents in certain areas of safety situations. The District’s homeland security officials said the WEA system “allows the messaging to be more targeted and efficient which is critical during an emergency.” Officials said they need to periodically test the emergency alert systems to “identify any needed improvements.” Plus, authorities said they must make sure there are “reliable methods and systems” to get out urgent messages and warnings to the public in the event of an emergency. local public-safety  Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Local Crime & Safety Email Alerts Breaking news about public safety in and around D.C.
