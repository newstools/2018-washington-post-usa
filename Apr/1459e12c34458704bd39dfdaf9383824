A 60-year-old man has been arrested and charged in the fatal stabbing of a woman near Gallaudet University in Northeast Washington last month, police said. Last week, a fugitive task force arrested Robert W. Dean Jr., of no fixed address, and charged him with first-degree murder while armed in the killing of Tamiya White, 38, of Northeast Washington. White was stabbed about 5 p.m. March 31 in the 1900 block of Ninth Street NE. Officers found her suffering from a neck wound. She was transported to a hospital, where she later died.
