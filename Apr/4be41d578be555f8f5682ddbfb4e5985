Fire damaged a house in North Arlington on Saturday night, authorities said. The blaze broke out at the rear of a house in the 2300 block of N. Quantico Street, according to the Arlington fire department. However, it did not extend into the house, the department said. The residential block of single-family houses is just south of Lee Highway about three-quarters of a mile northeast of the East Falls Church Metro stop.
