Warning if you’re thinking of seeing a little musical called “Fly by Night”: It hits you with a terrible sucker punch. You don’t see it coming, and I’m not sure it’s fair. It’s a mostly winsome show set in New York City during the year leading up to the 1965 Northeast blackout. The folk-pop score, played at 1st Stage by a three-piece band, is action-packed as a jittery narrator steers the story around — Wait, I need to tell you about this. Okay, now back to that. [What you should be seeing in D.C. theater this week] The bottom line is that it’s a romance involving two men and two women. You see early how they should pair off, and as charming as Kathryn Chase Bryer’s cast and brisk staging are, the songs and story by Kim Rosenstock, Will Connolly and Michael Mitnick are a little dull. It’s never as cute and cockeyed as it wants to be. Nor does it set you up for how dark it gets when the blackout comes. Yes, there’s an old hag fortuneteller — played by narrator Jamie Smithson, in an example of the show’s broad Fractured Fairy Tales approach to comedy — who forecasts good things and bad things. But this is not the kind of performance that gives you a clue that it’s going to get real. The tone switch is harsh. It’s possible you could fall in love hard with something this jaunty and melancholy. It’s fresh and unusual, and it says life is fast, hard, funny, sweet and just man, you never know. Bryer’s production nails the dusky romantic finish, with the cast harmonizing under a set of lightbulbs-as-stars. entertainment theater_dance        true Entertainment News Email Alerts Big stories in the entertainment world as they break.

But the script is too long, stuffed with numbers such as “I’m a Star,” about the budding actress who wants to move from South Dakota to New York (and does, with her upbeat young sister). I got bored almost for good in Act 2 when a shop owner and his employee sing about how they’re wasting their lives making sandwiches. The employee, who is also the guy torn between the sisters, is played by Aaron Bliden, an actor who brings earnestness and a graceful touch to just about everything he’s in. His performance is marvelous. It deepens just when the plot hurts you, sending you out of the theater in a daze.  Fly by Night, conceived by Kim Rosenstock, written by Will Connolly, Michael Mitnick and Rosenstock. Directed by Kathryn Chase Bryer. About 2 hours and 20 minutes. Through May 6 at 1st Stage, 1524 Spring Hill Rd., Tysons Corner. $38. 703-854-1856 or 1ststagetysons.org.
