Aubrey Bledsoe stopped Lindsey Horan’s penalty kick in the 87th minute Friday to preserve the Washington Spirit’s 1-1 away draw against the Portland Thorns before 14,485 at Providence Park. Bledsoe’s foul had led to the penalty kick when she crashed into Emily Sonnett on a high ball launched into the box. But on the ensuing attempt, Horan, a U.S. national team midfielder, did not strike the ball well and Bledsoe, sliding to her left, blocked the shot with her trailing legs. Washington (1-2-1, four points) remained winless in the Rose City (5-0-3 since 2013) but played well overall and generated several quality scoring chances. After conceding four goals at home against North Carolina last week, the defense was organized and the attack had slight advantage on shots and corner kicks. Bledsoe finished with five saves. Francisca Ordega scored in the 37th minute, her second of the year, before Christine Sinclair equalized deep into first-half stoppage time for the reigning National Women’s Soccer League champions (2-1-1, seven points). Thorns midfielder Tobin Heath, a U.S. national team star, made her 2018 debut when she entered in the second half. She had missed much of last season with a back injury and underwent ankle surgery early this year. Portland cleared two shots off the goal line during a scramble in the 26th minute. Eleven minutes later, the Spirit went ahead. Thorns goalkeeper Britt Eckerstrom (Germantown, Md.) failed to handle Tori Huster’s deflected corner kick in the six-yard box. While Eckerstrom reached for the stray ball, Ordega poked it across the goal line from a sitting position. On the final touch of the half, however, Sinclair converted a penalty kick two minutes into stoppage time after Caprice Dydasco had upended Ifeoma Onumonu. Washington will host the Chicago Red Stars next Saturday night at Maryland SoccerPlex.
