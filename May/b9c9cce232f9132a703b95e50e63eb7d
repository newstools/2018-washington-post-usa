Two men were killed early Monday at a hookah lounge in Sterling, Va., and an Alexandria man has been arrested and charged, according to authorities. The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office said the double homicide happened around 1:45 a.m. at the Pharaoh Cafe in the 46000 block of Old Ox Road. Deputies responded to the scene for a reported shooting. The victims were not immediately identified pending notification of their families. On Twitter, officials said that “two victims lost their lives at the scene.” The sheriff’s office said Hassan M. Gailani, 34, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of use of a firearm. Authorities said their initial investigation shows that Gailani walked into the cafe and “appeared to target one of the victims,” according to Kraig Troxell, a spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office. Gailani was found in his vehicle as he was trying to leave the area. He is being held without bond at the local jail, authorities said. The sheriff’s office said Monday that the two victims were men in their 30s. He said the two victims and Gailani were “associated with each other,” but their exact relationship was not clear at this time. “The circumstances as to what led to the shooting are still under investigation,” he said. Troxell said the hookah cafe is a popular place for people to hang out at after area bars close. The hookah cafe is open until 4 a.m.
