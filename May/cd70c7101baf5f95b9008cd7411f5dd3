A 2-year-old child was injured Sunday in Southeast DC, and his wound was at first believed to be the possible result of gunfire, according to D.C. police. However, further investigation indicated that the injury did not appear to be a gunshot wound, they said. The child was conscious when taken to a hospital with a leg injury, the police said. They said the injury was apparently suffered around 4 p.m. in the 1100 block of K Street SE. The matter came to light after the child was taken to the hospital, and an investigation began. Several hours later, police said they no longer considered it likely that the child had been struck by a bullet. In an e-mail message, a police spokeswoman said the case was being reclassified as an incident in which an injured person was taken to a hospital.      This story has been updated.
