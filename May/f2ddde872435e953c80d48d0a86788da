The Republican Party of Wisconsin voted overwhelmingly Saturday to endorse a state senator with close ties to Gov. Scott Walker for the nod to take on Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), a move that sets up another establishment-vs.-outsider primary for the GOP. State Sen. Leah Vukmir received 75 percent of the vote at the state Republican Party convention, well above the 60 percent threshold needed to win an official endorsement. Vukmir, however, still must compete in a primary in August against Kevin Nicholson, an outsider with financial backing from some Washington-based tea party groups that have stirred Republican primaries in the last eight years. Vukmir will enjoy the financial backing of the state party and its get-out-the-vote operation, a considerable edge. “It’s now time for us to come together as a party, and focus on beating Sen. Baldwin so we send President Trump another ally in the Senate who voters can trust to build the wall, repeal Obamacare, and defend the unborn,” she said in a statement after winning the endorsement. Baldwin began the election season as a top target for Senate Republicans. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in 2016, and Republicans performed well in statewide races in midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. But most top-tier Republicans passed on the race, and Baldwin had built a financial stockpile of more than $7.8 million by the end of March. Vukmir has been an ally of Walker’s in the state Senate. Among the well-known Wisconsin insiders speaking on her behalf Saturday, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus threw his weight behind her candidacy. Priebus served as state GOP chairman before taking the reins of the Republican National Committee in 2011. Nicholson aired a video at the convention showing the endorsements of Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), both of whom won contested primaries, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, by running against their state party’s establishment.
