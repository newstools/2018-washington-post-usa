The time has arrived: Over the next several days, broadcast networks will officially decide which TV shows will live on for another season. This annual process happens around Upfront Week in May, when executives from NBC, Fox, ABC, CBS and CW present their fall schedules to advertisers. Although the upfronts officially start Monday, many programming decisions have already been made — we’ll keep a continuously updating list starting today and throughout next week as we find out which shows are canceled. [Fox picked up ‘Last Man Standing’ after being ’emboldened’ by response to ‘Roseanne’] And although cable and streaming services operate on their own timetables, we also rounded up the fates of dozens of shows from HBO, Showtime, Netflix, Hulu, FX and more.
