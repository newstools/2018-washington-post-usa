BALTIMORE — For all of the emphasis the Orioles have placed on developing their own starting pitching, the last homegrown pitcher before David Hess to make his debut in the starting role he’d been groomed for in the minors was Mike Wright Jr. nearly three years ago. In the interim, pitchers like Hess have watched from the minors, built up fine résumés and hoped their own debut could be as simple — and successful — as his proved to be Saturday. Hess debuted not in mop-up relief nor as an emergency call-up but with a genuine opportunity to earn a rotation spot going forward. After Hess, 24, allowed four straight hits including a three-run home run in the first inning, he settled in for six sturdy innings and a quality start to help the Orioles win their fourth straight game, 6-3, in the front end of Saturday’s doubleheader against the Tampa Bay Rays. “It was fun to watch,” Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said. “One of the things we’ve always liked about David is his moxie. He showed you a little bit there. A lot of guys would have pulled the dirt around them a little bit. But he didn’t. That’s one of the things we liked about giving him the opportunity.” Hess struck out three, didn’t issue a walk and left after 78 pitches. The moment lived up to what he hoped it would be. “I can’t really even put it into words,” Hess said. “It’s just an experience that you literally dream about since you were a kid.” It helped that the Orioles erased his deficit quickly and made a winner of him. Jonathan Schoop hit his second home run of the season to open the second inning, and the Orioles tied it on an RBI double by Chance Sisco and a double-steal of home by the rookie catcher. Manny Machado tied for the major league home run lead with his 13th to open the third, and Schoop immediately followed with his second homer of the game to give Hess an insurance run. — Baltimore Sun
