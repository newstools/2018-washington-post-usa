Amid uncertainty over a planned U.S.-North Korea summit, President Trump warned Monday that China must continue to be “strong & tight” in enforcing trade sanctions against Kim Jong Un’s regime until a possible accord over the North’s nuclear program. “China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in.” Trump added: “I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!” China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing! Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet for their highly touted summit June 12 in Singapore. But the plans remain clouded after Pyongyang threatened last week to cancel the summit, and the White House continued to assess the political risks for Trump if he falls short of a sweeping deal to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. China is North Korea’s main trade partner, and its cooperation in enforcing economic sanctions is considered key to pressuring the country into an agreement.
