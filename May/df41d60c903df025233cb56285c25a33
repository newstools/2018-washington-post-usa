A 17-year-old male was fatally shot and two men were wounded Wednesday afternoon when at least one gunman opened fire on a Southeast Washington street, according to D.C. police. Authorities had initially described all of the victims as adults, but later said one of the people shot was a teenager. A police spokeswoman said the 17-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. The two other victims were taken to hospitals for treatment of injuries that police said did not appear to be life-threatening. The shootings occurred about 3:10 p.m. in the 300 block of Anacostia Road SE, just north of Fort Dupont Park, near a sprawling apartment complex. Cmdr. Leslie Parsons, head of the Criminal Investigations Division, said the juvenile victim was found dead on a sidewalk in front of an apartment building on Anacostia Road. The two other victims were found about two blocks away at Minnesota Avenue and Croffut Place. Police had no description of a gunman. Wednesday’s fatal shooting was the District’s fourth homicide since Monday night and the 54th this year. That is an increase of more than 40 percent since this time in 2017, when 38 people had been killed. This year’s victims have included five youths between ages 14 and 17.
