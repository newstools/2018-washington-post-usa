Kilauea on Hawaii’s Big Island is the world’s longest continuously erupting volcano. Lava has been flowing since 1983, but it usually doesn’t impact residential areas. That changed dramatically May 3 when a fissure opened in an area called Leilani Estates. Lava has been seen bursting into the air, as high as 330 feet in some locations. Molten rock has crept along the tropical landscape, covering roads. The slow-moving lava pushes through anything in its way. Parked cars have been burned and covered by the lava flows. The lava has destroyed at least 35 structures, 26 of which were homes, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.
