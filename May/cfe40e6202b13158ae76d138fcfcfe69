Senators pressed veteran spy Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the CIA, about her role in the agency’s 2005 destruction of videotapes documenting interrogation sessions with al-Qaeda detainees using brutal techniques, including waterboarding. Haspel said Jose Rodriguez, who was then director of the National Clandestine Service and her boss, took it upon himself to give the order to destroy the videotapes, and that she only drafted a cable. John Rizzo, acting CIA general counsel, says both Haspel and Rodriguez knew there was widespread opposition to destroying the tapes. In preparation for her confirmation hearing, the CIA declassified a 2011 internal disciplinary review, written by then-deputy CIA director Michael Morell, that Haspel and her allies have said exonerated her. But there’s less to this review than meets the eye, and various other accounts, including memoirs and interviews with former CIA officials, have raised questions about her role in the tape decision. Above is a video guide to the contradictions and questions, which we have also covered in a written fact check.
