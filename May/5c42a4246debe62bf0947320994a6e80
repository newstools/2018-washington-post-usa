A mother and her two young children died in a fiery crash early Monday morning after striking an alligator that had crawled onto an interstate in South Carolina, authorities said. Amber Stanley, 24, struck the gator as it was crossing northbound lane of Interstate 95 in Orangeburg just before 1 a.m., Highway Patrol Lance Cpl. Judd Jones told the Associated Press. Her Kia Soul then plunged into the median and hit a tree, causing it to catch fire, Jones said. The incident remains under investigation. Orangeburg County Chief Deputy Coroner Sean D. Fogle told The State newspaper that Stanley, her 4-year-old son Jack and 2-year-old daughter Autumn died of injuries due to the fire. Fogle said the family was from Callahan, Fla., just north of Jacksonville. More from Morning Mix: Florida deputy responded to a dispute about a cat. He was fatally shot in the head, police said.
