Agence France-Presse chief photographer Shah Marai, 41, was among the dozens of people killed Monday in a suicide bombing in Kabul. Marai was one of nine journalists lost in a second blast that targeted those first at the scene. Marai, a veteran photographer who had been working in his home country for 22 years, started at AFP as a driver. Those 22 years included 17 years of war, starting in 2001 when the United States removed the Taliban from power. His coverage of Afghanistan did not shy away from the carnage, but he still found and dutifully captured moments of humanity, culture and beauty present in the people and the land. The father of six had just celebrated the birth of his first daughter, Khadija, 15 days before his death. “This is a devastating blow, for the brave staff of our close-knit Kabul bureau and the entire agency,” said Michele Leridon, Agence France-Presse’s global news director. “We can only honor the strength, courage, and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism.” “He was a gentle being, always smiling, always in a good mood. He was a tall man full of thoughtfulness,” said Polka’s director of photography, Dimitri Beck, who met Marai in Afghanistan in the early 2000s. “He was a great team leader. Always calm and serene, very professional. He was a great photographer in a country where news photography was a new thing at that time. His loss is a great one for the Afghan press. This attack is representative of the state of freedom in general and press freedom in particular in Afghanistan.”
