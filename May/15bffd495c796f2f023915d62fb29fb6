Sports fans, set your DVRs, or rather, Netflix queues. ESPN’s “30 for 30” documentary film franchise is partnering with Netflix to produce a 10-episode series about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty, anchored by footage from Jordan’s last title run with the Bulls in 1997-98. Series producers have access to more than 500 hours of never-before-seen footage from that championship run, and Jordan and other key figures from the championship team have pledged access to interviews for the project.
