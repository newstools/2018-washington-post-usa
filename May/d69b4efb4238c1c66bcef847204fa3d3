Sunday, a day wholly without rain, brought to an end a seven-day stretch of rain and more rain, which set a record here, according to the National Weather Service. The record was for the number of consecutive days not just with rain, but with a substantial amount of it. In precise numerical terms it was for successive days with at least one-quarter inch. Obviously we have had days on which far more rain fell than on any day in the recent period. We have also had more consecutive days in which at least some rain fell. But the record set on the days from May 13 through Saturday was based on a combination of the length of the period and the amount of rain that fell each day. The record was reported Saturday night in a Twitter message from the local office of the National Weather Service. It was based on the readings made at Reagan National Airport, the official measuring station for the District. It said that Washington “has had at least 1/4” of #rain each of the last 7 days. This is the longest streak on record for the #DC area. “ According to the weather service, the previous record was five days. In six previous years, Washington recorded at least a quarter-inch of rain on five successive days. Those years were listed as 2011, 2009, 1975, 1950, 1942 and 1937. Over the record-setting wet spell, the least rain that fell on any day was .41 inches at the airport, on May 15. The most rain measured on any day in the period was 1.49 inches, which fell May 14.
