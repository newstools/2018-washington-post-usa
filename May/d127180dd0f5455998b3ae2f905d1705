President Trump offered support Wednesday for Tomi Lahren, a provocative Fox News pundit who had a drink thrown at her while leaving brunch at a Minneapolis restaurant over the weekend. “Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman!” Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after Lahren appeared on “Fox & Friends” to discuss the incident. Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends The president’s tweet came amid several others aimed at reports of the FBI’s use of a confidential source to seek information from several of his 2016 campaign aides. According to multiple reports, Lahren was heckled by patrons at the rooftop restaurant and got into a heated exchange before leaving. Videos of the episode surfaced on social media, gaining national attention. Lauren, 25, who regularly voices support for Trump, has sparked controversy with calls for limited immigration and other conservative views. In 2016, she sparked outrage with a since-deleted tweet that compared the “Black Lives Matter” movement to the Ku Klux Klan. After this weekend’s episode, several liberals came to Lahren’s defense, including comedian Kathy Griffin. “I couldn’t disagree more with @TomiLahren, but I don’t think it’s cool to resort to physical actions to make your point,” Griffin wrote.
