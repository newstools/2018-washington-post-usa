Well, that didn’t take long: NBC announced late Friday night that it has picked up cop comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” for a 13-episode sixth season, one day after Fox canceled the series and sparked a worldwide outcry from fans on social media. As “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” trended worldwide on Twitter for hours after its cancellation, the producers were reportedly flooded with calls from other networks and streaming services. But this move makes sense, given that the show is produced by Universal Television, which shares a parent company with NBC. [Is your favorite TV show canceled?

This will be Schur’s third series on the network, along with “The Good Place” and recently-ordered comedy “Abby’s”; he was also a co-creator on “Parks and Recreation” and executive producer of “The Office.” After a roller coaster day of emotions, the producers and cast weighed in ecstatically on Friday night: Read more: Why ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ fans are taking its cancellation so hard If Brooklyn Nine-Nine does get canceled, the Sterling K.
