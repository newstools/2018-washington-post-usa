For all the concern over leaks at the White House,Â a more pressing problem might be the sinkhole on the North Lawn that appears to be growing by the day. The pit in the ground, which was first reportedÂ by White House correspondents on site this week, appears to have opened just outside the press briefing room and deputy White House press secretaryÂ Hogan Gidleyâ€™s office. Steve Herman, a reporter with Voice of America, tweeted that he first spotted the sinkhole last week. It has since grown, and another sinkhole has opened next to it.

It's just too easy #sinkhole #whitehouse #whitehousesinkhole This isnâ€™t the first time one ofÂ President Trumpâ€™s residences has been vexed byÂ a sinkhole. Exactly one year ago to the day, a sinkhole opened in front of Mar-a-Lago, Trumpâ€™s estateÂ in Palm Beach, Fla. That hole, which was about 4 feet by 4 feet, was much larger than its White House counterpart appears to be. Palm Beach officials blamed the widening ditch on a newly installed water main in the area. Still, many believed it was a sign of something, well, deeper.
