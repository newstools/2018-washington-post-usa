William Florescu, the general director of the Florentine Opera Company in Milwaukee since 2005, abruptly resigned his post this week, only two years after the company extended his current contract through 2024 and a few days before his new production of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” opens Friday. Asked for the reason for the resignation, a spokesman for the company only repeated, “Bill Florescu has resigned from the Florentine,” adding, “We remain committed to our mission of presenting world-class opera to our community.” The spokesman refused further comment. Florescu is a stage director and an administrator; he is scheduled to direct both Monteverdi’s “The Coronation of Poppea” and Beethoven’s “Fidelio” at the Florentine Opera next season. His name still appears as general director on the company’s website. The company did not comment on the future of those productions. At the Florentine Opera, Florescu expanded the repertoire and reputation of a company that was founded in 1933 as the Italian Opera Chorus. He oversaw premieres and recordings of new work, including “Elmer Gantry” by Robert Aldridge, “Rio de Sangre” by Don Davis and “Wuthering Heights” by Carlisle Floyd, and expanded the company’s focus to include its first Baroque opera and its first Bellini opera. He established a young-artist program and oversaw touring operas for children. In 2016, when announcing the extension of his contract, the president of the Florentine Opera board, Adam Wiensch, said in a statement, “Bill has been a visionary and dynamic leader of the Florentine Opera Company for over 10 years. I am thrilled to extend his contract, and am looking forward to an exciting future.”
