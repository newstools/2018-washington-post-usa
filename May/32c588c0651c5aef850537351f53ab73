A woman was killed, and five people were taken to a hospital after a three-car crash early Sunday on Columbia Pike near Fairland Drive in Silver Spring, Md., Montgomery County police said. One of the drivers was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. About 3 a.m., police responded to Columbia Pike near Fairland Drive for reports of a serious crash, Officer Rick Goodale said. A black Honda Pilot and a silver Honda Pilot had initially been involved in a minor collision and had stopped in the southbound lane, he said. The driver and a front-seat passenger of the black Pilot had gotten out and were standing near the vehicle — perhaps to check for damage, Goodale said, when a silver BMW headed south on Columbia Pike struck them and their SUV. The driver of the black SUV, My Huong T. Nguyen, 45, of Greenbelt, died at the scene. Two passengers were transported to a hospital with injuries that weren’t life-threatening. The BMW driver, Ivan William Kadian, 29, of Hyattsville, Md., was arrested on suspicion of DUI. He was not injured, but a man riding in his car was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. Two people in the other Pilot were taken to a hospital with injuries that weren’t life-threatening, Goodale said.  Get updates on your area delivered via email
