President Trump on Friday staged a show of support for his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, following reports suggesting Kelly’s days at the White House could be numbered. Trump and Kelly appeared side-by-side before reporters at Joint Base Andrews, shortly before the president took off on Air Force One en route to Dallas, where he was scheduled to address a gathering of the National Rifle Association. The pair had nothing but praise for one another, brushing off news reports such as one from NBC News last week relaying that Kelly had told administration officials that Trump is “an idiot.” “I want to just tell you something. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job.” Trump said on Friday. “There has been such false reporting about our relationship. We have a great relationship. He’s doing a great job as chief of staff. I could not be more happy.” [Kelly denies calling Trump an ‘idiot,’ says news report is ‘pathetic attempt to smear people’] Kelly returned the compliments. “It’s an absolute privilege to work for a president who has gotten the economy going,” Kelly said. “We’re about to have a breakthrough, I believe, on North Korea. The jobs report today, I mean, everything is going phenomenally well .... It’s nothing less than brilliant what’s been accomplished in 15 months.” The Washington Post has not independently confirmed that Kelly called Trump an “idiot,” but the chief of staff has occasionally referred to the president in derisive terms and has threatened to quit, current and former White House aides have said. Kelly, who joined the administration in July and was charged with instilling discipline and order into a chaotic West Wing, has fallen out of favor with Trump in recent months and is no longer included in many key decisions, according to White House aides.
