Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and recent addition to President Trump’s legal team, has a warning for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III: Steer clear of Ivanka Trump. In his freewheeling interview Wednesday night with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity, Giuliani said the country would “turn” on Mueller if he went after the president’s eldest daughter, who is also a White House adviser, as part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “Ivanka Trump? I think I would get on my charger and go ride into their offices with a lance, if they go after Ivanka,” Giuliani said. “Now if they do do Ivanka, which I don’t think they will, the whole country will turn on them. If they go after her, the whole country will turn on them. They’re going after his daughter?” Giuliani was responding to a recent Politico story that explored why Mueller has yet to call Ivanka Trump as a witness, given her proximity to some key events he appears to be investigating. Politico described it as a signal of a“don’t-poke-the-bear-until-you-have-to” strategy. Among other things, Ivanka Trump was in Bedminster, N.J., with Trump during the May 2017 weekend when he decided to fire FBI Director James B. Comey. She was also a passenger on the plane flying home from the G-20 conference in Germany the next month, when Trump and others crafted a response to the 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, also a White House adviser, has testified before the special counsel’s team. During Wednesday night’s interview, Giuliani called Kushner a “fine man,” but added that “men are disposable.”
