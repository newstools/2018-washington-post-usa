KEVIN SMITH tweeted fans early Monday that he had suffered a “massive heart attack” after shooting a comedy special in the Los Angeles area. “If I hadn’t canceled show 2 to go to the hospital, I would’ve died tonight,” Smith tweeted from the hospital. “But for now, I’m still above ground!” Smith, the 47-year-old filmmaker (“Clerks,” “Mallrats,” “Chasing Amy”), writer and star of the AMC reality series “Comic Book Men”, was reportedly shooting “Kevin Smith Live!”, his new standup special, in Glendale, Calif.  Smith, whose feature directing career has spanned his breakthrough 1994 hit “Clerks” to 2016’s “Yoga Hosers,” had posted on Facebook hours earlier about his show taping.

As a performer, Smith debuted his Silent Bob character in “Clerks” as a mute comic foil to fellow slacker Jay, played by Jason Mewes. In 2013, Smith staged a reunion tour with Mewes, anchored by their podcast and a new “Jay and Silent Bob Super Groovy Cartoon Movie.” Smith told The Washington Post’s Comic Riffs in 2013 that the film was “a benchmark of his sobriety” in referring to his longtime friend Mewes, who had battled addictions to heroin and OxyContin. entertainment  comic-riffs       true Entertainment News Email Alerts Big stories in the entertainment world as they break.
