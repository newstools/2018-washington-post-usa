One woman was stabbed Wednesday night during an attack in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Northwest Washington, D.C. police said. Authorities found the woman conscious and breathing in the 1400 block of Girard Street about 9:53 p.m., said Officer Hugh Carew, a police spokesman. Police were called to investigate the report of an aggravated assault in progress, Carew said. Intially, D.C. police reported that there were four stabbing victims, but about 45 minutes after the investigation began, Carew said only one victim had been stabbed. It was not immediately clear what led to the erroneous preliminary account. Police stopped two people in reference to the incident, but officials did not announce any arrests. The condition of the victim was not immediately available.
