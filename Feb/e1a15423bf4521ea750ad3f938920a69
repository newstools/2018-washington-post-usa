A teacher was taken into custody Wednesday after he fired at least one shot inside a Georgia classroom, police said. Jesse Randall Davidson, a 53-year-old social studies teacher, barricaded himself inside a classroom at Dalton High School on Wednesday morning, the Dalton Police Department tweeted. One student who injured her ankle as the school was being evacuated was treated by medics at the school. No other children were injured or in danger, according to police. The Georgia State Patrol also responded to the incident. Davidson was charged with aggravated assault, carrying a weapon in a school zone and making terroristic threats, among others, according to Whitfield County Sheriff’s Office records. Dalton police spokesman Bruce Frazier said students tried to enter Davidson’s classroom about 11:30 a.m., but the teacher wouldn’t allow them in, according to video of press conferences posted by WTVC-TV. Davidson forced the door shut when the principal tried to open it.
