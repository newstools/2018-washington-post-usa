Sometimes a little violin envy can go a long way, even for an award-winning cellist such as Narek Hakhnazaryan, whose ­admiration for the smaller string instrument elicited his best playing during a recital Sunday afternoon at the National Gallery of Art. Before launching into his own arrangement of the “Meditation,” originally written for violin, from Jules Massenet’s opera “Thaïs,” Hakhnazaryan told the overflowing audience that performing it had once been a childhood dream. Hakhnazaryan’s rendition soared tenderly as he played with conviction, demonstrating his mastery of the lyrical line. Hakhnazaryan is a compelling artist who performs with an ease that belies his technical prowess. The immediacy of his sweet, soulful playing, coupled with the tonal purity of his 1707 Joseph Guarneri cello, made for gorgeous phrases in Schumann’s Adagio and Allegro, Op. 70. With pianist Noreen Cassidy-Polera, Hakhnazaryan tamed the West Garden Court’s notoriously reverberant acoustics in Brahms’s Cello Sonata No. 2 in F Major, Op. 99. As the piano created an intricate tableau, the cellist carved out his melodic lines in meticulous detail. Applying a quick vibrato in the second movement, Hakhnazaryan achieved an anguished edge and then dazzled with fastidious finger work in the third movement. Exploring timbres in Sulkhan Fyodorovich Tsintsadze’s “Five Pieces on Folk Themes for Cello and Piano,” Hakhnazaryan sounded like a plucky guitar in “Tchonguri” and evoked rustic Georgian instruments in “Sachidao” and “Dance Tunes.” But it was in “Villain’s Song on a Carriage,” and “Nana,” with its haunting melodies and harmonies, where he excelled. Isaac Albéniz’s rhythmic ­“Asturias” and Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin’s “Imitating Albéniz” inspired bravado bowing, while a robust encore of ­Paganini’s “Variation on One String” made a fine chaser for Hakhnazaryan’s celebratory take of Gaspar Cassadó’s “Requiebros.”
