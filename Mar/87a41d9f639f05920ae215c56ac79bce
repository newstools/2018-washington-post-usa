A person familiar with the owners’ thinking said there would be discussions on the national anthem policy at this meeting aimed toward a possible resolution at the May owners’ meeting in Atlanta. That person said that all possibilities remain under consideration, from making no change to the policy to keeping players in the locker rooms until after the anthem is played before games to requiring players to stand for the anthem. The NFL’s policy, outlined in its game operations manual, requires players to be on the sideline for the anthem and suggests but does not require that they stand.
