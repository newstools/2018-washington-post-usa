OMAHA — The habitual winners at Duke might cringe years into the future over a basketball so bloody indecisive that it seemed to touch every smidgen of iron as it lollygagged around the rim, kissed the backboard, ventured back to the rim and then rolled off toward the floor as if deciding it craved overtime. The habitual winners at Kansas might revel years into the future over a basketball so blasted gorgeous that when it went up from the left corner and arced downward, it seemed not so much to swish as to smash down, as if deciding it aimed to stoke some bedlam. Meanwhile, the 17,579 witnesses inside CenturyLink Center on Sunday evening will chatter years into the future over their ticket-buying luck at seeing this Midwest Region final because of all the gasps and palpitations and frenzy and quality it provided. And at last, the heavy majority that yearned for the Jayhawks will know their team surmounted a big heap of difficult stuff because they whistled boldly through the corridor of their goblins and haunts, the Elite Eight, and the 85-81 overtime win signaled Kansas could withstand both that and the constellation of stars at Duke. “It’s hard to describe, man,” said Kansas senior leader Devonte’ Graham, the consensus all-American whose gut the Jayhawks’ Elite Eight losses in 2016 and 2017 had attempted to mangle. Yet describe, the participants did. Blue Devils Coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose record in this oft-torturous round in the NCAA tournament dipped to a still-celestial 12-3 and caused him an ashen final walk down the hallway afterward, called it “an honor to play in this game.” Kansas Coach Bill Self, whose reddened reaction upon the final horn hinted at apparent demon-banishment, called it “a big-boy game” and “two blue bloods that’ll beat each other’s heads in” and “a heavyweight fight” and “the second-best win that we’ve ever had,” after only the 2008 title game against Memphis. “I would have been proud to coach in that game even if the outcome was different,” he said. Indeed, Kansas ventures to the third Final Four of Self’s 15 seasons — and its first in six years — by riding a demanding rodeo of a game that played out with ludicrous evenness. Kansas made 30 of 69 field goal attempts; Duke made 30 of 70. Kansas used rebounding by scrapping committee to beat Duke on the boards 47-32; Duke used beyond-freshman moxie from its freshmen to commit only 11 turnovers to 18 from its opponent. Duke sprang for five players in double figures; Kansas presented four with another guy at nine points. Duke giant Wendell Carter Jr. fouled out in overtime; Kansas giant Udoka Azubuike fouled out two minutes before overtime. Duke (29-8) never led by more than four. Kansas (31-7) never led by more than seven, and when it did, with 16:06 left, Duke cleaned up most of that in a jiffy. The Blue Devils received a fine game from their lead star, Marvin Bagley III, with 16 points and 10 rebounds and two assists; the Jayhawks had a soaring game from one of their two lead stars, Malik Newman, the transfer from Mississippi State who scored 32 points, including the paramount shot from the corner with 1:49 left in overtime. Duke had large splashes from its slightly less famous freshmen, Trevon Duval and Gary Trent Jr., who scored 20 and 17 points and also made confident drives; Kansas had shrewd Lagerald Vick operating from the middle of the Duke zone with 14 points, Graham with six assists and six rebounds, and 6-foot-8 senior Svi Mykhailiuk with 11 points and 10 rebounds and pretty damned good defense on the 6-11 Bagley and . . . And Kansas’s second-biggest shot. It came with 26 seconds left in regulation, and Mykhailiuk’s audacity in taking it exemplified Kansas’s audacity all told. He had just missed two open three-point shots as things had begun to creak with a hint of familiarity for the Jayhawks. After Duke senior captain Grayson Allen’s four perfect free throws in the penultimate minute pushed the Blue Devils ahead 72-69, Newman missed with 1:05 left, Bagley rebounded, Carter missed with 36 seconds left, 6-9 freshman Silvio De Sousa rebounded, and March had gone into franticness as only March can. The ball wound up with Mykhailiuk at the right of the top of the key, and his shot sang its way through, tying the score, leaving the whole heaving occasion with the two shots that might hang on in memory. With the seconds ticking more furiously than normal, the game distilled to Allen against Newman, one-on-one. Newman’s defense excelled. Allen’s move wasn’t bad. He wound up backing off at the left side of the lane and sending up a promising shot that could not seem to help itself from skittering around in fickleness and tantalizing all the spectators. It rolled off, the horn sounded, and soon Allen’s fine and checkered four-year college career would conclude with him at his locker in a silent room, dutifully answering questions with a skill he had learned to master. “It’s way different than a [regular] loss,” he said, “because with a loss, you know you’ve got something else. There’s two parts in me, one still fighting” for the closing Final Four dream, “and the other, ‘Sorry, it’s done.’ That’s why it’s really hard to grasp.” In between the fickle ball and that, the teams had insisted upon remaining tied, this time at 78-78, as the two-minute mark of overtime arrived. In tension, Kansas forged beauty. Graham kicked a pass to Vick amid the zone, and Vick, whom Newman credited rightly with “a great job in the middle,” never touched the ground in redirecting that thing hurriedly to the left corner to Newman. Newman had spent much of the game driving with an unafraid abandon because “Coach just told us to keep attacking the zone,” and by getting “paint touches, then the three-point line would open up.” Here the three-point line opened up, and now he lofted one to try to put a pinnacle on his hot March and let Kansas lead and let Duke chase, let Duke fizzle on offense until the score became 85-78 and let Kansas’s heart both intensify and then leap, all of which happened after that prettiest of shots smashed down.

That would be the “60 Minutes” interview with Stormy Daniels, who was set to tell all about her alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006. That show was set to air immediately after the game, but it ran a bit long — into overtime, in fact — leading to some unhappy viewers. Turned on @CBS 10 mins ago, expecting a porn star on @60Minutes.

Duke forward Wendell Carter Jr. re-entered the contest at the 7:30 mark, despite his four fouls, while Kansas’s seven-footer, Udoka Azubuike, was also saddled with four fouls. .@KUHoops is dishing the rock! Jayhawks hold a five-point lead with 7:30 left!#MarchMadness #Elite8 pic.twitter.com/J75M0HMqby Tight start to high-profile matchup The matchup of the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds pitted two of college basketball’s marquee programs against each other, and it was a fittingly tight start on CBS, with the lead seesawing back and forth, before the first half ended with Duke ahead of Kansas, 36-33.  Those 20 entertaining minutes featured numerous ties and lead changes, but it also featured three personal fouls on Blue Devils forward Wendell Carter Jr., which could hamper his playing time in the second half. Duke guard Trevon Duval, one of its many talented freshman, led all players with 13 points, while teammate Gary Trent Jr., another first-year player, chipped in with nine. Senior guard Devonte’ Graham paced Kansas with eight points, but his team was sloppy with the ball, committing eight turnovers to Duke’s four. Battle of the Bluebloods is heating up 🔥#MarchMadness #Elite8 pic.twitter.com/4TF421sqvp The Blue Devils also had six steals to the Jayhawks’ one, but neither team was able to shoot the ball well, particularly from three-point range, where Duke was 3 of 15, while Kansas was 4 of 14. The Jayhawks’ Malik Newman and Lagerald Vick combined to go 4 of 17 from the field. “They’re playing their butts off, we’re playing our butts off,” Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski told CBS, as the teams headed to their locker rooms. “Hopefully we can keep it going.” Duke’s biggest lead of the half was four points and the Jayhawks came right back with a six-point run that was good for a 27-25 lead with four minutes left. That lasted a little more than a minute, and then the lead went back and forth again. Malik Newman. Too smooth. 🔥#MarchMadness #Elite8 pic.twitter.com/uSQ03ClFW6 Duke held a 22-19 lead about 12 minutes in thanks in part to eight Kansas turnovers.

The program, you might have heard, features an interview with Stormy Daniels. *** Pregame reading: OMAHA — A common fan complaint in the one-and-done era is that those who fasten their gazes on an adored college basketball team no longer have the time to construct their adoration of players. A contrast of the ancient, four-year reality and the nouveau, one-year reality will happen Sunday afternoon here when two first-team consensus All-Americans reach the same court on opposing sides. One is freshly 23, the other freshly 19. One will have played 141 college games in a steady climb to All-American. One will have played 37 games in an All-American spot that seemed deserved already in preseason. By nightfall, one will depart the brackets. Kansas might bid farewell to its beloved 23-year-old Devonte’ Graham, and in that case, the sentiment has had time to evolve across years, since the arrival of the 6-foot-2 guard with the gorgeous game in Lawrence in the long-ago days of 2014. Hear Coach Bill Self speak of Graham, and the words tell of uncommon appreciation and collaboration. [ CBS’s Dana Jacobson asks a question Florida State’s Leonard Hamilton won’t answer ] “I think his legacy is cemented right now,” Self said Saturday, “and he’ll go down as one of the all-time greats. He’ll have his jersey retired. He’s an All-American. He’s player of the year in our league. But more importantly than that, I think he’s the best intangible guy we’ve ever had here and has as good of leadership qualities as anybody I’ve ever coached. So he’s been the complete package as a player, and basically he’s a guy that I don’t think coaches get an opportunity to coach but every few years.” Even though Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski clearly loves 19-year-old Marvin Bagley III and Bagley’s family, Krzyzewski won’t get the time to deepen the love with years of daily collaboration with the 6-foot-11 marvel with the rare mix of ginormous talent and ginormous will. Those unwieldy, spirited beasts, the NBA mock drafts, long since have been calling for Bagley to turn up in a high spot such as No. 1. As Bagley’s Duke plays Graham’s Kansas with a glut of terrific players joining them on the floor, Bagley arrives knowing this Final Four chance will be it. “I think about that a lot,” Bagley said Saturday, showing how the days of let’s-wait-and-see answers have subsided in favor of the shouting truth. “But I wouldn’t say it’s pressure. We’re all in this thing together. So that’s one thing I know going into every game is that I’m not the only one experiencing this.” Ask Duke fans if they would prefer three more seasons of watching and listening to and getting to sort-of-know Bagley, the way fans sort-of-know their stars, and the percentage of those saying yes would appear to be 100.00. Simply the way Graham speaks demonstrates a familiarity sometimes found in the four-year players but near-impossible in the one-year. He has two prior Elite Eight exits to discuss, and says of younger teammates, “Even though they might not have been in the two games, they can feel how we feel.” Asked to pinpoint when Kansas’ seven-loss season turned around, Graham provides a clear-cut answer: that loss on Feb. 3 at home against Oklahoma State, on a weekend that invited decorated former players and celebrated the history-packed 120 years of Kansas basketball. “After we lost to Oklahoma State at home, we just had a come-to-Jesus meeting, I would say, with the coaching staff, just looking at each other eye-to-eye,” Graham said, soon adding, “Oh man, that was one of the most awkward situations I’ve ever been in, ‘Coach’ blasting us in front of everybody and all the former players . . . It was awkward.” He smiled his excellent smile. With Bagley, whom the sport doesn’t know as well, the eye goes naturally to the talent. The collected stories of a life only 19 years going so far revert to eighth grade, as when Krzyzewski told how the famed NBA owner and executive Jerry Colangelo showed Krzyzewski a video of the Arizonan Bagley on his phone and said, “This kid is an eighth-grader.” “I said, ‘He is?’” Krzyzewski said Saturday. Self: “I remembered what everybody remembered (about Bagley), is that he’s different. He’s different. The thing that impressed me most about — and we tried to recruit Marvin, obviously, some — but the thing that impressed me most about him is to be more talented than everybody but also to play harder than everybody. He’s got a great motor. And that motor was in AAU ball. The motor was in high school. I’ve always thought that he played as hard as anybody, anytime I’ve ever watched him play. And then when you’re more talented and do that, then obviously that’s going to mean great things.” Those great things will spend either one, two or three more games in college. Schedule: No. 1 seed Kansas (30-7) and No. 2 seed Duke (29-7) will tip off at 5:05 p.m. Saturday on CBS. [ Duke’s Grayson Allen on being a villain: ‘I own it now’ ] How Kansas got here: How Duke got here: Regular season results: Kansas didn’t lose consecutive games after early-December losses to Washington and Arizona State. The Jayhawks won their 14th straight Big 12 regular season title, with Devonte’ Graham earning Big 12 player of the year honors and Bill Self tying for the league’s coach of the year award. Malik Newman earned the Big 12 newcomer of the year award after transferring from Mississippi State and then sitting out a season. Kansas finished 24-7 (13-5 in the Big 12), and won the league tournament to claim a No. 1 seed. Graham averaged 17.6 points, 7.2 assists and 4.0 rebounds in the regular season, while Newman was the tournament MVP after averaging 24 points in three games. Duke’s early season included both impressive nonconference wins (over Michigan State and Florida) and peculiar ACC losses (to Boston College and N.C. State). The Blue Devils beat rival North Carolina to close the season, finishing with a 25-6 record (13-5 in the ACC) and earning the No. 2 seed in the conference tournament. A loss to the Tar Heels in the ACC semifinals sent Duke into this event as a No. 2 seed. Bagley averaged more than 20 points and nearly 12 rebounds a game, and became just the second ACC player to win both freshman of the year and player of the year honors, joining Jahlil Okafor. Wendell Carter Jr. nearly averaged a double-double, and was named second-team all-ACC.
