Aperture Apartments, a 421-unit, six-story residence across from the Wiehle-Reston East Metro station in Reston, Va., blurs the line between city and suburban living while making space for art, nature and technology. Co-developed by the Bozzuto Group and Veatch Commercial Real Estate and designed by KTGY Architecture + Planning, the apartment building at 11410 Reston Station Blvd. was designed with an entry plaza to showcase an art installation. A bronze and stainless-steel sculpture by Zachary Oxman, who was born and raised in Reston, was selected for the spot. Indoors, the building includes long stretches of wall space to display contemporary nature photography. Aperture residents live adjacent to the Metro station and to the Washington and Old Dominion Bike Trail and less than two miles from Reston Town Center. Future plans for Reston Station include office buildings, restaurants, shops, more residences and a hotel.
