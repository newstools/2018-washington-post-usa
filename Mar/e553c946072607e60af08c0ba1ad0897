Two firefighters were injured Tuesday night in one of three house fires in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, authorities said. One of the firefighters suffered serious burns and the second was less seriously injured at the house fire in the Clinton area, according to Mark E. Brady, spokesman for the county fire department. Brady said the injuries came when part of a roof collapsed in the blaze in a two story house in the 6100 block of Willow Way. A second house fire broke out in the 14600 block of Cactus Hill Road in the Accokeek area. During that blaze, the first floor of the house collapsed into the basement, Brady said. In the third house fire, flames damaged what appeared to be a vacant house at Bock and Livingston Roads in Oxon Hill. It was not clear what role was played by wind in the Tuesday night wires. Gusts of more than 30 mph were reported at times on Tuesday.
