The second round of the Big Ten men’s basketball tournament gets underway Thursday at Madison Square Garden, marking the first time the event has been held in New York. Here’s the updated bracket and a look at the field:  [At the Big Ten basketball tournament, March comes early — too early, many say] All times Eastern. FIRST ROUND Game 1: No. 12 seed Iowa 96, No. 13 seed Illinois 87 Skinny: The Hawkeyes won their first conference tournament game in five years on an impressive outing by guard Jordan Bohannon, who scored 25 points and had six assists. Tyler Cook added 19 points and five rebounds, while Luke Garza finished with 20 points and eight rebounds for Iowa (14-18). The Illini, under first-year head coach Brad Underwood, will miss the NCAA tournament for a fifth straight year with the loss. Game 2: No. 14 seed Rutgers 65, No. 11 seed Minnesota 54 Skinny: Guard Corey Sanders scored 23 points to lift the last-place Scarlet Knights (14-18), the hosts for this year’s Big Ten tournament, to a victory over the Gophers. “That 14 doesn’t represent the team that we are,” Sanders said postgame. Minnesota finishes a disappointing 15-17 after beginning the season ranked No. 15 in the country.

A turnover by Dion Wiley on their following possession sealed a bitter end and extinguished faint NCAA tournament hopes for the Terps (19-13). Wisconsin improved to 15-17 overall and advanced to play top-seeded Michigan State on Friday.

The Wolverines, the defending conference tournament champions and one of the best stories of last March, survived poor shooting from deep (3 of 19 on three-pointers) and from the free throw line (18 of 32) to improve to 25-7. Charles Matthews led all players in the choppy, foul-riddled game with 16 points. Game 5: No. 7 seed Penn State 65, No. 10 seed Northwestern 57 When: Thursday, 6:30 p.m., Big Ten Network Skinny: A tight game became unwound in the late stages, when the Nittany Lions staged a 15-5 run over the final 4:56 to knock out last year’s darlings, the Wildcats. Sophomore guard Tony Carr lit up the box score, scoring 25 points, hitting on 6 of 10 three-point attempts, grabbing six rebounds and dishing four assists in helping Penn State to advance. Its reward is a date with No. 2 seed Ohio State Friday evening. The Nittany Lions won both of their meetings with the Buckeyes during the regular season, including a 79-56 blowout in State College, Pa.,  just two weeks ago. Game 6: No. 14 seed Rutgers 76, No. 6 seed Indiana 69 Skinny: An upset to close out the day. The Scarlet Knights, just 3-15 in conference play headed into the postseason, got 28 points from junior guard Corey Sanders, and held off the Hoosiers down the stretch to earn their second win in as many days. Rutgers may be out of magic, with a game against No. 3 seed Purdue up next. But that doesn’t change the fact this is the first time the Scarlet Knights have won two games in a conference tournament since they were in the Big East back in 1998. QUARTERFINALS Game 7: No. 9 seed Wisconsin (15-17) vs. No. 1 seed Michigan State (28-3, 16-2) When: Friday, noon, Big Ten Network Skinny: The Spartans are a national championship contender and perhaps the most complete team in the country, having clinched the outright regular season title with a hard-fought, 68-63 win at Wisconsin in the finale. [Izzo says his Spartans team will only answer ‘basketball questions’] Game 8: No. 5 seed Michigan (25-7) vs. No. 4 seed Nebraska (22-9, 13-5) When: Friday, 2:30 p.m., Big Ten Network Skinny: The Cornhuskers enter the week squarely on the NCAA tournament bubble and need a win over Michigan here to buffer their portfolio; that still might not be enough for a team with 13 league victories but no quality nonconference wins. Game 9: Northwestern-Penn State winner vs. No. 2 seed Ohio State (24-7, 15-3) When: Friday, 6:30 p.m., Big Ten Network Skinny: The Buckeyes were the league’s surprise this winter, rejuvenated by first-year Coach Chris Holtmann, who was selected as Big Ten Coach of the Year. That hardware was accompanied by player-of-the-year honors for forward Keita Bates-Diop, who finished second in the league in scoring (19.2) and rebounding (8.9). Game 10: Rutgers-Indiana winner vs. No. 3 seed Purdue (26-5, 15-3) When: Friday, 9 p.m., Big Ten Network Skinny: The Boilermakers have the best shot to challenge Michigan State for the championship, although Matt Painter’s team trended downward in February. Purdue lost three straight to Ohio State, Michigan State and Wisconsin before rebounding with wins in its final three games, against Penn State, Illinois and Minnesota. Purdue is projected as a No. 2 seed in the South Region of the NCAA tournament, according to the most recent bracket projection for The Post by Patrick Stevens.
