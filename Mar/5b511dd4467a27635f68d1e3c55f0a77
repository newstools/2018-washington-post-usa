Gov. Larry Hogan (R) does know a thing or two about upsets. His stunning win in the 2014 gubernatorial election over then-Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (D) was one of the biggest shockers in Maryland politics. So, when the governor filled out his bracket for the 2018 men’s tournament on Thursday, he went with University of Maryland Baltimore County, the underdog, advancing past No. 1 Virginia in the first round. “They say a 16 will never upset a 1, but we’ve been known to beat the odds around here from time to time,” Hogan wrote on Facebook Thursday at noon, before the first March Madness tip off. In 136 games, a No. 16 seed had never defeated a No. 1 seed until Friday night’s UMBC-Virginia game. Of course, rooting for the home-state team in Catonsville was a smart bet for Hogan, who is seeking re-election. The public university, with 13,600 students, is known for excellence and innovation in teaching science and engineering. It doesn’t get as much attention as the state flagship university in College Park, but higher education insiders know UMBC as a school rising in prestige. Its president, Freeman A. Hrabowski III, has led UMBC since 1992 and is a relentless and well-known cheerleader for the school. Amelia Chasse, Hogan’s spokeswoman, said Saturday that the governor spent Friday evening watching the game at the governor’s mansion with his family, including two of his daughters and their husbands. While the majority of brackets were blown with UMBC’s historic 74-54 win on Friday night, Hogan - like the Retrievers - is still in it to win it. After the final buzzer, he tweeted: “NAILED IT.” Chasse said Hogan, who toured UMBC’s campus recently, had a little help with filling out the rest of his bracket. His speechwriter, Kata Hall, is obsessed with college basketball and helped with the other picks. But there was no question about UMBC, Chasse said. That was all Hogan, she said. “He insisted on UMBC going all the way,” she said.
