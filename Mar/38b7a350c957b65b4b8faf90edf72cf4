When spring weather teases Washington-area residents, their thoughts often turn to summer plans to be by the water. The vacation home — or year-round residence — at 1072 Woodstock Rd. in King George, Va., rests on Mathias Point on the Potomac River and has water views from many rooms. A sunroom is the perfect spot to gather to watch the sunset from indoors. The house, priced at $850,000, is about 50 miles from the District, making it a reasonable destination as a weekend retreat. The 1.95-acre site includes 200 feet of waterfront land with a private beach protected by a 231-foot sea wall, a beach deck and an observation deck. The 80-foot dock has several boat slips as well as a 180-square-foot fishing dock, an 8,000-pound boat lift, two rotating jet-ski lifts, electricity and water access.

The house has an open floor plan with a great room, hardwood flooring, vaulted and nine-foot-high ceilings, built-in bookcases, a gas fireplace and a large kitchen with granite counters, white cabinets, stainless-steel appliances and a center island.
