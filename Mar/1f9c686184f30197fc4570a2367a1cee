For the tour behind super-producer Dan Auerbach’s breezy, poppy second solo LP, “Waiting on a Song,” the Black Keys guitarist is bringing along session musicians from his Nashville studio to back him as The Easy Eye Sound Revue. Given that he also just started a SiriusXM show, “The Easy Hour,” we asked Auerbach to name the first three songs that popped into his head. 9:30 Club, 815 V St. NW; Thu., 7 p.m., sold out. ‘You Won’t See Me’ by The Beatles As a producer, Auerbach especially appreciates this “Rubber Soul” track. “It’s so well recorded, great parts, great playing,” he says. “It’s inspirational. [The Beatles] were still kinda Tin Pan Alley songwriters but they were getting a little bit experimental.” express  express Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Today's Headlines newsletter The day's most important stories.
