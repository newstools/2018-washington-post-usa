Perry Farrell has fronted a seminal rock act in Jane’s Addiction and was the driving force behind the Lollapalooza music festivals. For most people, that’s enough creativity to last a lifetime. But Ferrell is still cranking out ideas at the age of 58, the latest being a 100,000-square-foot, Southeast Asian-themed attraction in Las Vegas featuring food, shopping and live music. All that, plus virtual monkey wrestling. The Las Vegas Review-Journal’s Wade Tyler Millward buried the lede a little bit in his story Tuesday announcing Ferrell’s plans for what he’s calling Kind Heaven, which will be located between Harrah’s and the Flamingo, across the street from Caesars on the Las Vegas Strip. There will be venues for musical acts, and holograms of artists, and an attraction that will resemble a forest. Plus a venue that will “feature virtual monkeys that wrestle each other. Patrons can bet on which monkey will win for prizes,” Millward wrote, without elaborating further on this game-changing addition to the gambling universe. Maybe it will look like this: Maybe Ferrell’s idea will one day be expanded to include intra-species virtual animal wrestling, because what’s not to like? One has to assume that actual monkey wrestling would be far too unpredictable to handicap and likely would run afoul of many local animal-welfare ordinances, even in Las Vegas. But I’m struggling to come up with any argument against virtual monkey wrestling. It’s some next-level stuff. Just take my money, Perry Ferrell. Kind Heaven and its wagering on virtual monkeys is scheduled to open in 2019.
