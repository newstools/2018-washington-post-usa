The latest models favor Monday’s “storm” as a nonevent. Precipitation should be light and spotty, moving in between sunrise and midday. The best chance for snow and/or rain should be during the afternoon, but, with temperatures above freezing, little or no accumulation is expected. If there is any accumulation, it should be limited to grassy areas. Capital Weather Gang winter weather expert Wes Junker chimes in with this assessment: This storm is shaping up to be another cruel tease for snow lovers. Yes, may see a little snow but the bulk of the precipitation will stay well to our south. The two streams of flow are not expected to phase until the storm is too far offshore to give us more than a period of light snow which could mix with rain. The fact that most of the snow is slated to fall during the day when temperatures are likely to rise into the upper 30s in and around the city argue against any meaningful accumulations for the Interstate 95 corridor. If the snow lingers into Monday evening a light accumulation of less than an inch on grassy surfaces might be possible. We do not expect snow to cause any travel problems or school disruptions. Some tweaks to the forecast are still possible, but we do not anticipate they’ll be major.
