The curious case of Corey Feldman’s stabbing report has taken an interesting turn. The former child actor said late Tuesday that he was in the hospital after being attacked that evening. In early morning Wednesday tweets, Feldman wrote that a man had opened his car door and stabbed him with something. He even included photos of himself being treated at the hospital. But according to the Los Angeles Police Department, there are “no lacerations to Mr. Feldman’s abdomen,” spokesman Luis Garcia said. IM IN THE HOSPITAL! I WAS ATTACKED 2NITE! A MAN OPENED MY CAR DOOR & STABBED ME W SOMETHING! PLEASE SAY PRAYERS 4 US! 🙏🏼🙏🏼 THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY MYSELF & MY SECURITY IN THE CAR, WHEN 3 MEN APPROACHED! WHILE SECURITY WAS DISTRACTED, W A GUY A CAR PULLED UP & ATTACKED! I’M OK! pic.twitter.com/TZ0ppZeEWN Police received a call around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday reporting an assault with a deadly weapon. Feldman told police that he was driving his car with a passenger and was stopped at a red light at the intersection of Reseda and Ventura boulevards when “someone, an unknown person, opened his driver side door and jabbed at his abdomen with an unknown object,” Garcia said. Feldman then took himself to the hospital, where he was treated and released, according to police. While Feldman said he was stabbed with a sharp object, police know of no injuries and have no suspect or weapon descriptions. Feldman didn’t tweet what he had been stabbed with but wrote — in all caps — that he was in his car with his “security” when three men approached the vehicle. “While security was distracted,” he wrote, a man “pulled up & attacked! I’m OK!” Police were investigating “the case as an attempted homicide!” he continued. He also tweeted that he has received “mounting threats” on his social media platforms from a group he called the “wolfpack” and that he believes the attack is connected. @LAPD R CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE AS AN ATTEMPTED HOMICIDE! I HAVE HAD MOUNTING THREATS ON ALL SM PLATFORMS BY THIS VILE “WOLFPACK” & THIS IM SURE IS A RESULT OF THOSE NEGATIVE ACTIONS! I HAVE REASON 2 BELIEVE ITS ALL CONNECTED! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! HOW SICK R THESE PPL?!? He followed up with tweets containing links to articles picking up on his report, such as “Corey Feldman stabbed by knife-wielding thug in frenzied attempted murder attack.” MORE DETAILS COMING SOON: Corey Feldman stabbed by knife-wielding thug in frenzied attempted murder attack https://t.co/K6PHqgr5Sl Feldman has alleged that he and others were sexually abused when they were child actors by those in the entertainment industry. When the revelations around powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein first came to light in October, Feldman announced that he was going to name names. But he received criticism after he said he needed to first raise $10 million to finance a film that would be the “most honest and true depiction of child abuse ever portrayed.” He eventually publicly accused two men. A month later, the LAPD announced that it was no longer investigating an assault report that Feldman had filed with the department because the statute of limitations had expired. lifestyle  arts-and-entertainment       true   Please provide a valid email address.
