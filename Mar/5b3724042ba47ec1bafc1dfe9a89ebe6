Three weeks, three winter storms. The first one blasted New England with gusts up to 97 mph and knocked out power to 2 million homes and businesses. The second dumped as much as 3 feet of heavy, wet snow from Philadelphia to Boston. This one is causing whiteout conditions in southern New England, where snowfall totals were already approaching 12 inches late Tuesday morning. Snowfall totals through 11 a.m. By the time this storm is over on Wednesday, as much as 18 inches of snow will have fallen in Boston. On the Cape, up to 24 inches of snow is expected — and just as much will fall well into Maine. The National Weather Service in Boston said this storm was officially a blizzard for areas along the coast that are seeing the strongest winds combine with heavy snowfall rates. Boston had three straight hours of blizzard conditions as of 12 p.m., meaning visibility dropped to nearly nothing.  On top of that, thousands are without power as of Tuesday morning, and the tally will likely grow through the afternoon as conditions worsen in New England.
