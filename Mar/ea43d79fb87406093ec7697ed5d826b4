Maryland State Police divers found the body of person in the wreckage of a plane that was reported missing Thursday and was discovered crashed in the waters off the coast of Ocean City. Divers recovered the body from the fuselage of a single-engine, four passenger plane that had been reported missing just after 10 a.m. Thursday. The aircraft had left Martin State Airport en route to Ocean City Wednesday night, but did not return as expected to the originating airport, authorities said. The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center began the search when the beacon from the Cessna 172 was not transmitting the location, according to a statement from the U.S. Coast Guard. The body was discovered just after 5 p.m., said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Ronald Hodges, a spokesman. Coast Guard officials said that they believe two people were aboard the plane and identified them as Banica Richard Robinson and Marcson Ngwa. Authorities did not identify the body that was recovered. As police searched the area near Ocean City Airport, they located what was described as an oil slick in the ocean, about 1.5 miles from airport, state police said in a statement. Rescue crews focused their search on that area and Natural Resources Police officers recovered debris believed to be from the plane, the statement said. Officials said the search included the State police Underwater Recovery Unit along with the U.S. Coast Guard, Natural Resources Police, Worcester County Sheriffâ€™s Office, and the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center.
