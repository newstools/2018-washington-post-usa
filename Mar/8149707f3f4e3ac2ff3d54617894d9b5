President Trump signaled late Friday night that he will not ban all transgender members of the U.S. military from serving, but deferred to a new Pentagon plan that is significantly more restrictive than a policy adopted by the Obama administration in 2016. The decision was acknowledged in a memorandum that was released by the White House and revoked a full ban that Trump issued in August and first announced in July on Twitter. The memorandum was filed Friday amid ongoing court battles in which the Trump administration has sought to block transgender recruits from joining the military. The new filing included a memorandum from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who recommended to Trump that any transgender service member who has undergone sex-reassignment surgery be involuntarily separated from the military. This is a developing story. It will be updated.
