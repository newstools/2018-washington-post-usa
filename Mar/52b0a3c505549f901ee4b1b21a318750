The gunfire at the Westfield Montgomery shopping mall on Friday night did not appear to be a random event, Montgomery County police said Saturday. Investigators thought that all of the shots fired in the incident at the mall in Bethesda involved only people who had argued before the gunfire broke out, authorities said. As pieced together by investigators, four men, two on each side, got involved in a dispute that began off mall property. The argument continued in a mall parking lot, where shots were fired, the police said. All four then fled. A report of gunfire sent police to the mall. They found no one there who had been wounded, they said. But they discovered indications that shots had been fired, authorities said. In addition to shell casings, they found parked vehicles that had been struck, police said. Police said they were continuing to investigate.
