Two people were killed late Thursday night in a house fire in Prince George’s County in a dwelling with hoarding conditions, according to authorities. Their names were not immediately released, pending the notification of relatives and an autopsy, fire officials said. It was not known whether the two who were killed were related. In a Twitter message, Mark Brady — a spokesman for the Prince George’s County Fire Department — said the fire happened at the home in the 500 block of Round Table Drive in Fort Washington. The fire broke out around 11:30 p.m. Firefighters were alerted by a 911 call from a neighbor. When firefighters arrived, the two-story split level home had a “well advanced” fire underway, according to Brady. He said there were “unsafe conditions” and firefighters could at first only fight the blaze from the outside. The two people were found in the home by firefighters and pronounced dead at the scene. One firefighter suffered minor injuries that are not considered life-threatening.
