Hey, isn’t that … former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, continuing their tour of D.C.’s newest restaurants with dinner on Friday at Hank’s Oyster Bar’s new Wharf location? The couple were joined by a few friends, including Valerie Jarrett, a longtime top Obama aide, we’re told. The casually dressed group looked to be having a low-key night out, but the occasion was a big deal for Hank’s chef and owner, Jamie Leeds. “When welcoming, them I became star struck,” she tweeted after the couple’s meal. “Obama held out his hand immediately saying the food was great. I almost called Michelle, Madame President. It was so surreal.”
