A man was arrested Tuesday and charged in the deaths of a woman and her adult son in their Loudoun County home in January, the county sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office said Brian K. Welsh, 38, of Herndon, was charged with two counts of first degree murder in the shootings in the Aldie area of the county. Officials said the killings appeared to be drug-related. The two victims were identified as Mala Manwani, 65, and her son Rishi Manwani, 32. The sheriff’s office said both were found dead Jan. 31 in their home in the 25000 block of Tomey Court. Authorities went there after being notified that the woman had not been to work that week. An investigation determined that the suspect was known to the son, the sheriff’s office said. “It is believed the two were involved in narcotics activity inside the home,” the office said. The woman was not thought to be an intended target, the sheriff’s office said.
