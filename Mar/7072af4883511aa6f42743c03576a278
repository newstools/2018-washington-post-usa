If this date weren’t between two people of science, I’d probably call what happened at the start of the evening an omen. Instead, I’ll go with a more secular metaphor and say that biology PhD student Alyssa King tripped out of the gate on her date with Bradley Arnold, a biomedical researcher at the National Institutes of Health. They were to meet at the Turkish small-plates spot Ezmè near Dupont Circle. Bradley showed up on time; Alyssa rolled in, by his estimation, 20 to 25 minutes late. Why so tardy? Well, she went through the wrong door to another restaurant attached to the same building. “It’s not completely her fault, but you’d think you could read a sign on the door,” recalled Bradley. “It ended up being more funny than awkward,” Alyssa said. “We laughed about it, me and Bradley.” Hmm. “She tried to make it into a joke like, ‘Wow, I’m so dumb I went downstairs,’ ” said Bradley, who described himself as “semi-annoyed” by Alyssa’s lateness. As it happens, Alyssa may have had better luck finding love had she stayed in the wrong restaurant: When I asked Bradley to narrate his night to me, he said, “Oh, God!” They came to the date with different agendas; Bradley got out of a “fairly long” relationship eight months ago and isn’t looking to settle down. Meanwhile, Alyssa is actively looking for a partner and feels her age of 25 is “a little old to not ever have been in a long-term relationship.” She’s been dating and often finds herself underwhelmed by the guys she sees. I told her it was a good sign that she wasn’t settling, to which she responded, “Yeah ... I’m gonna say that from now on!” Stay strong, Alyssa. One of the first things Alyssa and Bradley learned about each other after sitting down is they both have science backgrounds. But biology in this case did not yield chemistry. “It was pretty nice to not have to work around what my project actually is,” Alyssa said of her staph research. “A lot of the time, talking to nonscientists, the words I’d choose are very different than if I’m talking to a scientist.” “I would have preferred probably a different subject,” said Bradley. “I tend to be friends with people who are not from work or who are in a political realm.” A bigger issue, perhaps, was that Bradley felt more like an audience member than a participant in the conversation. “It was hard to even change the subject,” he said. “If I tried to say anything it’d be quickly interrupted by some very, very long story or rambling.” And so, over hummus, baba ghanouj, salmon kanepe and a veggie kebab, he mostly just listened. Alyssa didn’t remember it that way, but she wasn’t surprised to hear that Bradley had. “I tend to talk a lot when I’m nervous,” she explained. No one wanted Alyssa and Bradley to work out more than I did. The science backgrounds seemed like a no-brainer, and Bradley had requested an intellectual. So what gives? Bradley admitted that he was “not especially” attracted to Alyssa and that if he had been and the conversation had moved at a different rhythm, this might have been a different story. Alyssa conceded that Bradley was “cute” but wasn’t sure if she was attracted to him either. And then there was Bradley’s 23-year-old, fresh-out-of-college greenness, which didn’t really jibe with Alyssa, a wizened 25-year-old. She was not sure whether she telegraphed this apprehension to Bradley. For his part, Bradley did not let on that he felt slightly trapped. His politeness may have fostered ambiguity during the date, but he didn’t leave it that way. After walking Alyssa to her bus stop, he gave her a half hug and departed without getting her number. Alyssa said she didn’t realize that until it was too late. “I hadn’t gone on a date where I didn’t have the person’s contact information beforehand, so I didn’t think of it as something I needed to do,” she said. When asked, Alyssa admitted she “probably” would go on a second date with Bradley, but then remarked that the fact that she didn’t immediately notice he left without her digits suggested she isn’t really that interested. lifestyle magazine        true Must Reads newsletter 5 stories you can't afford to miss, every Saturday.
