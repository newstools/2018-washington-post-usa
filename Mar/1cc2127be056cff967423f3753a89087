It is not too much to expect in Washington that by mid-March we might exhale, relax a bit, and stow away the snow gear along with that wintry fear of flakes. But a glance at the National Weather Service forecast issued Friday for the coming seven days and seven nights included the word snow five times. On Monday night, for example, the Weather Service said rain or snow was likely, with the chance of precipitation at 60 percent. It appears that the cold is to blame. Atop its Web page, the local forecast office said, “With cold temperatures, chances of snow will persist through March.” With March about two degrees colder than average, we cannot dismiss snow worries. It appears yet unclear how the apprehensions evoked by the possibility of snow compare with the well-documented difficulties posed by actual snow.
