President Trump may exempt Canada and Mexico from new tariffs on steel and aluminum, reversing his original insistence that the import restrictions apply to U.S. allies as well as countries such as China, the White House said Wednesday. “We expect that the president will sign something by the end of the week, and there are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. Any such exemptions will be determined on “a case-by-case and country-by-country” basis,” she said. business  business     false after3th true Economy & Business Email Alerts Breaking news about economic and business issues.

The announcement came after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a last-minute appeal for flexibility, saying that overly broad tariffs could damage relationships with U.S. allies. The statement also followed efforts by lawmakers and representatives of industry groups seeking waivers from the new import taxes and came amid continued confusion over the president’s plans. Earlier this week, Trump suggested that he would exclude Canada and Mexico from the new levies only if they made concessions in negotiations aimed at reaching a new North American free-trade deal. Officials from both countries rejected the demand, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling the new tariffs “absolutely unacceptable.”
