Bored with the same old stainless-steel and chrome fixtures? Brass can add a splash of color and luxury and help modernize an outdated kitchen. “The resurgence of brass in home design is bringing a new level of warmth back to kitchens,” says kitchen designer Jennifer Howard of JWH Design & Cabinetry. The soft, rich and sleek material can provide a subtle contrast of color with kitchen appliances, and it especially shines in all-white and neutral surroundings. “Mixing in a touch of brass is a great way to add visual interest while offsetting the cooler tones of stainless, whites and grays,” Howard adds.
