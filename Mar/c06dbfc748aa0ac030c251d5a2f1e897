Efforts continued in Maryland Sunday to clear the area where four cars from a freight train plunged off a high bridge into the Susquehanna River. In a spectacular and unusual incident, the four cars plunged as much as 80 feet into the water after six cars derailed Friday night during the fierce wind storm in the region. The cause of the derailment and the toppling of the cars into the water were under investigation, according to a spokeswoman for CSX, which operated the train. It was not known whether the wind played any role. The spokeswoman said a freight train headed to Richmond derailed about 8 p.m. Friday on the Susquehanna railroad trestle in Cecil County, Md. No injuries were reported, the spokeswoman said, and no hazardous materials were involved In a statement released at noon Sunday, the spokeswoman said that between Saturday night and Sunday morning two cars were removed from the rail trestle and taken to a staging area. Tracks were repaired to allow restoration of service, the statement said. Two cars were removed from the river Sunday morning, and efforts were under way to remove the other two, the spokeswoman said. It was not immediately clear just how far the freight cars fell. But photographs at the scene show the two derailed cars that remained on the bridge. By rough estimate, the distance from the tracks to the water at that point appears to be about two car lengths or about 80 to 100 feet.
