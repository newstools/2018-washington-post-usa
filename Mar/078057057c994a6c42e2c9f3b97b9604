We still had some wind to contend with, as always these days, it seems, but it wasn’t a bad one otherwise. Highs around 50 are about 10 degrees below normal. Chilly conditions persist tonight and into tomorrow. Actually, we will probably lose a few degrees on Tuesday as clouds and some rain move through.

This helps temperatures fall quickly as the sun sets. Some increase in clouds late in the night should keep readings from falling too far, though. Plus, it’s almost April! Lows eventually fall into the upper 20s to mid-30s. View the current weather conditions at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Tuesday): Clouds should be numerous by sunrise, although perhaps we will get one of those early shows before they thicken entirely. By midday, the risk of showers is on the rise, although I think we can stay dry into early afternoon. Whatever falls should be light and perhaps scattered. There is some question as to how high temperatures get before any rain arrives, and much of it is related to timing. For now, let’s go with mid-40s or so. Plan on some potential mainly to edge up if rain is slow. See Jason Samenow’s forecast through the weekend. And if you haven’t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
