A woman who was fatally stabbed in an alley in Congress Heights on Thursday has been identified as a 52-year-old from Southeast Washington, according to D.C. police. Police said Maria Antoinette Evans was pronounced dead at a hospital. She was found shortly before 8 a.m. lying unconscious in an alley in the 500 block of Oakwood Street SE. An autopsy determined Evans had been stabbed several times, and her death was ruled a homicide. Police have not discussed a possible motive. On Friday, police released the womanâ€™s name and publicized a surveillance video that shows a man detectives believe was involved in the attack. It shows two people walking behind what appears to be a tall fence dividing a backyard from an alley. The video shows them emerge from the alley and walk away in separate directions. Police said they are focusing on a man seen in the video. Police would not say if the video showed the same alley where Evans was found.
