In German, music is divided not between “pop” and “classical” but between “serious” music and “entertaining” music. And the idea that entertainment is associated with populism, and is therefore somehow bad, is one of American art music’s biggest problems. I experienced this vividly at a triple-header of concerts on Sunday: a piano recital by Fazil Say presented by the Phillips Collection, followed by two events at the Kennedy Center’s Direct Current festival of contemporary performance. Say is a Turkish pianist and composer whose political views have gotten him in trouble with the Turkish government and who had a two-part focus at the Phillips this week, with a concert of his own music Thursday night. On Sunday, he certainly espoused the view that music is Very Serious Indeed. He leaped at Beethoven’s Op. 111 as if the sonata were a depiction of the deaf composer clawing in frustration at the piano, which rattled in shrill pain under this harsh treatment. But the contrasting poetry in the quiet passages, which might have given more depth to such an approach, was largely absent. The recital concluded with his own sonata (“Gezi Park 2,” op. 52), explicitly about Turkey’s political situation, with movements such as “Nights of Resistance on the Streets of Istanbul” (jagged, angry chords) and “On the Killing of the Innocent Child Berkin Elvan” (melodic, pop-song mourning) earnestly executed, as was the rest of the performance, with a mournfully furrowed brow. Direct Current represented a change of pace but not of mood. Sunday focused on National Sawdust, the new(ish) performance venue in Brooklyn, founded by the composer Paola Prestini, that bills itself as a fulcrum for the cutting edge in contemporary music. An energetic concert by Sophia Brous and Marc Ribot at the Millennium Stage was followed by Murat Eyuboglu’s 2016 documentary film-with-live-music “The Colorado,” about the river, first in a projected trilogy (next up: the Amazon). Brous and Eyuboglu are National Sawdust artists in residence. entertainment music        true   Please provide a valid email address. Prestini, to judge from her own work, puts a premium on large-scale earnestness. This was evident in the incoherent program notes for the Brous/Ribot concert (which opened by citing Nietzsche) and even more evident in “The Colorado.” Eyuboglu’s film is like a National Geographic feature, set to a shifting score by Glenn Kotche, Shara Nova, John Luther Adams, William Brittelle and Prestini herself, performed by Kotche, the cellist Jeffrey Ziegler (formerly of the Kronos Quartet, and Prestini’s husband), and the vocal octet Roomful of Teeth. The result was pretty, and ponderous. And I’m not sure why it needed to be art, apart from the desire to put its conservationist, preservationist message in a more grandiloquent frame. There was a lot to like in the score, and I am happy to hear live music performed with films, but this film kept drawing itself up into a pause with pretty pictures, so that the singers could expound on its themes in texts we couldn’t quite understand. I got a lot more from Brous and Ribot, along with Simon Hayes on bass and the multitalented Shahzad Ismaily on percussion and synthesizer. Their performance was called “When the World’s on Fire,” and it was unclear whether it was conceived as a single piece or as what it seemed to be, a set that ranged from protest songs to lullabies (part of an ongoing project of Brous). It certainly had big aspirations, including serving as raw protest (“Donald Trump loaded the gun” sang Ribot in a song about Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the engineer who was the victim of a 2017 hate-crime shooting in Kansas”). It didn’t need to work so hard, though, to be high art. It was a good show of strong music­making that was even — dare I say it — entertaining.
