A five-hour barricade ended early Monday in Northwest Washington with no injuries and the arrest of one man, D.C. police said. The situation started shortly before 1 a.m. and ended just after 5 a.m. Police responded to an apartment house in the 3700 block of Connecticut Avenue near Rodman Street in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for a noise complaint, officials said. A man, later identified as Robert D. Gingell, allegedly threatened police officers. A barricade was then set up. Several streets in the area were blocked off for hours. Eventually, the barricade ended, and Gingell was arrested and charged with threats to do bodily harm, officials said.
