North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has asked President Trump for talks, an invitation delivered by South Korea’s national security adviser, according to U.S. officials. After a year in which North Korea fired intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching all of the United States and tested what is widely thought to have been a hydrogen bomb, any break in the tensions between the two countries would likely be welcomed around the world. There has never been a face-to-face meeting, or even a phone call, between the sitting leaders of the two countries. This is a developing story. It will be updated.
