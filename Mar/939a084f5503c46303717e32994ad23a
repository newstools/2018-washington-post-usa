Childish Gambino Capital One Arena, Sept. 19, $79.50-$129.50. “Atlanta” star and creator Donald Glover started making music almost as a joke — his alias, Childish Gambino, came from a Wu-Tang name generator — but now he’s headlining arenas under that name, playing the hybrid hip-hop, soul and funk found on 2016’s “Awaken, My Love!” Get tickets: Friday at noon through Ticketmaster. Robert Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters Merriweather Post Pavilion, June 12, $59.25-$129.25. Robert Plant has made it clear he has no interest in a Led Zeppelin reunion — and that’s fine! Instead, he’s touring the country with the Sensational Space Shifters as his band, singing new music and reworking old Zep tunes like “Misty Mountain Hop.” Sheryl Crow joins him as the opener for this area date. Get tickets: Friday at 10 a.m. using Ticketfly. Bombino The Hamilton, July 12, $20-$30.
