Tired of Metro delays and crowded buses in your daily commute? Here’s a new idea from electric-car pioneer and space entrepreneur Elon Musk. It’s dubbed an “urban loop system” and is designed for pedestrians and cyclists. In a video posted online, Musk touts one of his latest ideas from the Boring Co. It shows a white carrier that looks like a half-bus, half-train being lowered from street level with people inside. Once underground, it runs through tunnels and lanes. The video shows it traveling about 125 mph. It is not clear where — or when — the Boring Co. plans to initiate the new way of getting around. In a Twitter message, Musk said the transportation mode “would have 1000s of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination & blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city, rather than a small number of big stations like a subway.” It generated plenty of buzz on social media, with some supporting it and others unsure how it would be built or operate. Musk has said he has another transportation idea underway. He wants to build a high-speed “hyperloop” that would have tunnels and pods to get people between New York and Washington in 29 minutes. Musk has said he got “verbal” government approval for his tunnel-digging firm to build the “NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop” on a lot near the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives along New York Avenue in Northeast Washington. local  gridlock Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Local Headlines newsletter Daily headlines about the Washington region.
