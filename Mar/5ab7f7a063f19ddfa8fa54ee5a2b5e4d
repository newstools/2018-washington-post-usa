A teenager who went into the Potomac River in Montgomery County was swept downstream and nearly drowned before being rescued, authorities said. The teenager, from Virginia, went into the water intentionally, “was swept under” and carried about a mile downstream, said Pete Piringer, the spokesman for the Montgomery County fire and rescue service. He was found south of Rocky Island, Piringer said, a site that is downstream from Great Falls Park, Piringer said. In a Twitter message, Piringer said the teenager was taken to a hospital in serious condition. He described the incident as a “near drowning.”
