The first round of the Pac-12 men’s basketball tournament begins Wednesday afternoon with four games at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Here’s the full bracket with start times and broadcast information. And keep up with the ACC, SEC, Big 12 and Big East tournaments, which are also ongoing.  [One crying moment: The stories behind the most gutting losses in NCAA tournament history] All times listed below are Eastern. FIRST ROUND Game 1: No. 8 Colorado 97, No. 9 Arizona State 85 Skinny: McKinley Wright IV had 20 points and 11 assists, and the Buffaloes put a dent in the Sun Devils’ NCAA tournament in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament Wednesday. Colorado (17-14) made 13 of 21 from three-point range and took control of a close game with a 15-1 run midway through the second half. The Buffaloes shot 54 percent overall and made 18 of 20 free throws to earn a spot in Thursday’s quarterfinals against No. 15 Arizona. — Associated Press Game 2: No. 5 Stanford (17-14, 11-7) vs. No. 12 California (8-23, 2-16). When: Wednesday, approximately 5:30 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Skinny: The Cardinal enter the postseason having won four of five, though most of the victories came against the conference’s lesser lights. It’s a big improvement, however, from early in the season, when Stanford lost to Eastern Washington, Portland State, Long Beach State and a Cal team that is on the verge of its first season without double-digit victories since 1987-88. Game 3: No. 7 Washington (20-11, 10-8) vs. No. 10 Oregon State (15-15, 7-11). When: Wednesday, 9 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Skinny: Even though Mike Hopkins was named the Pac-12’s coach of the year in his first season in Seattle, the Huskies likely will need a few wins in Las Vegas to earn their first NCAA tournament bid since 2011, when they last won the conference tournament. Since then, Washington is 1-6 in the Pac-12’s postseason event. Game 4: No. 6 Oregon (20-11, 10-8) vs. No. 11 Washington State (12-18, 4-14). When: Wednesday, approximately 11:30 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Skinny: Coming off late-February wins over Arizona State and Arizona, the Ducks’ NCAA tournament hopes were looking up. Then they promptly laid an egg last Thursday in a two-point loss to the same bad Washington State team Oregon plays Wednesday. The Ducks’ best hope now is a run to the tournament final, and even that might not be enough. [How to the NCAA tournament’s bubble teams stack up? Let’s look at the quadrants.] QUARTERFINALS Game 5: No. 1 Arizona (24-7, 14-4) vs. No. 8 Colorado 97 (17-14, 8-10) When: Thursday, 3 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Skinny: The Wildcats will have Coach Sean Miller, forward Deandre Ayton and shooting guard Allonzo Trier on hand after various in-season controversies, which makes them a heavy favorite in Las Vegas. Miller and Ayton — seen as a possible if not probable No. 1 pick in the NBA draft — allegedly are entwined in the FBI’s investigation into college basketball, while Trier missed two games after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. Game 6: No. 4 UCLA (20-10, 11-7) vs. Stanford-Cal winner. When: Thursday, approximately 5:30 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Skinny: Steve Alford has kept the Bruins afloat after their early-season shoplifting incident in China, which resulted in season-long suspensions for Jalen Hill and Cody Riley and the departure of LiAngelo Ball. But UCLA stands to slide right off the bubble without at least one win in the conference tournament. [SEC tournament TV schedule, bracket and team previews] Game 7: No. 2 USC (21-10, 12-6) vs. Washington-Oregon State winner. When: Thursday, 9 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Skinny: Sporting a remarkably similar resume to their crosstown rival but having lost twice to UCLA in the regular season, the Trojans also could stand to win a game or two to erase any doubt about their NCAA tournament worthiness. Game 8: No. 3 Utah (19-10, 11-7) vs. Oregon-Washington State winner. When: Thursday, approximately 11:30 p.m., Fox Sports 1. Skinny: Like just about everyone else not named Arizona in the Pac-12, the Utes are in the NCAA tournament conversation but shouldn’t be scouting first-round venue hotels just yet. If anything, the play-in games in Dayton might be their best hope, barring a run to the Pac-12 tournament final. [Big 12 tournament TV schedule, bracket and team previews] SEMIFINALS Game 9: Game 5 winner vs. Game 6 winner. When: Friday, 9 p.m., Pac-12 Network. Game 10: Game 7 winner vs. Game 8 winner. When: Friday, approximately 11:30 p.m., Fox Sports 1. FINAL Game 11: Game 9 winner vs. Game 10 winner. When: Saturday, 10 p.m., Fox Sports 1.
