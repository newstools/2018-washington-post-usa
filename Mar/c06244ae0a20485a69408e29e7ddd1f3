Finding a place to buy in the District for less than $400,000 can be difficult, especially if your requirements include more than one bedroom and you prefer a newly built property in a walkable community. One option that works for many city buyers is a condo — but make sure you know how much you will pay in condo fees and what that expense covers. For example, the condo at 1244 Raum St. NE, No. 1, is priced at $379,000. This condo, one of five in a newly converted building, has a monthly condo fee of $103. Annual property taxes are $4,266. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo has 800 square feet. The condo has hardwood flooring throughout, an open floor plan, stainless-steel appliances, a walk-in closet in the master bedroom and modern bathrooms with ceramic tile floors. Appliances include a stacked washer and dryer. This unit also has a fully fenced yard. Pets are allowed.
