A man dressed in drag as Queen Elsa from the movie “Frozen” ran out of a bar Tuesday night to help a Boston police wagon stuck in the piles of snow left by a nor’easter that hit the region. As onlookers cheer, Elsa pushes the wagon, then hikes up her gown to get a better angle, a video shows. She directs the wagon backward and forward and even bends down to clear snow away from a tire with her hands. Christopher Haynes, a restaurant publicist, was at The Gallows bar Tuesday evening during the snowstorm. In the packed bar, he saw a man he knew walk in wearing an Elsa costume. “My neighborhood is a little colorful, so I didn’t think too much of it,” Haynes said. “Two minutes later I saw Elsa outside. You can’t make this stuff up.” He decided to take a video of the heroic feat. [ Tuesday’s blizzard dumped as much as 2 feet of snow in Eastern Massachusetts ] Bar patrons whoop and holler for Elsa, identified by the Boston Globe as Jason Triplett, 37, a lawyer who told the Globe he bought the costume last year and wore it to the bar as a gag. In the video, patrons scream “Come on, Elsa!” and “Let him go!” as they chuckle in disbelief. And they cheer wildly when the truck drives away. Elsa takes a dramatic curtsy. On social media, the other bar patrons were criticized for not going out to help. Haynes said they were too stunned. “I feel a little guilty we didn’t help push,” Haynes said. “But Elsa had it taken care of, clearly.” local  inspired-life       true Inspired Life newsletter Weekly inspiration to improve your life.
