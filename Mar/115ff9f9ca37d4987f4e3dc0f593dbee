A substitute teacher for Montgomery County schools has been charged for inappropriately touching a student, police said Saturday. Steven Katz, 59, of Columbia, Md., is charged with sexual abuse of a minor and a fourth-degree sexual offense after a student at Clovery Elementary School in Silver Spring came forward about a March 8 incident, Montgomery County police said. The student told his parents after school that his substitute teacher touched him in a way that made him feel uncomfortable, police said. The student identified the teacher as Katz. During an investigation, Katz admitted to inappropriately touching the student, police said. An arrest warrant was issued, and Katz turned himself in to police Friday night. Montgomery County schools did not immediately respond to an email seeking Katzâ€™s employment status with the district. Detectives are requesting that parents of juveniles who may have had contact with Katz talk with their children about any interactions they may have had with him. Detectives can be contacted at 240-773-5400.
