At times when disruption upsets the routines of daily life, strangers often show camaraderie in recognition of shared hardship. But that spirit seemed a bit lacking in the District on Friday. At least four robberies were reported on city streets during the hours of fierce winds and gusts. In the first incident, two people made off with a purse about 6:45 a.m. in the 2600 block of Newton Street NE, police said. The purse held a car key. The robbers drove off in their vehicle, but returned and took the victim’s car. Winds were already gusting to 40 mph and higher. About 8 p.m., a man with a gun carried out a robbery in the 1500 block of Church Street NW, according to police, who said he made off with only $3. A 50 mph gust was measured around then. Later, an armed carjacking was reported about 9:30 p.m. in the 4300 block of 12th Street SE. At about the same time, a robbery was reported in the 600 block of 12th Street NW, police said. A 30 mph wind and 38 mph gust were reported about that time.
