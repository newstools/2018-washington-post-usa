President Trump has invited representatives of the video game industry to a meeting at the White House next week, days after he suggested a link between violent games and a recent spate of deadly school shootings including in Parkland, Fla. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the upcoming session during her press briefing Thursday, though she and other White House officials did not immediately offer an official list of attendees. In the aftermath of the attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 students dead, Trump said that the “level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts.” In 2013, President Barack Obama called on Congress to set aside $10 million and allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study whether violent video games and other media contributed to gun violence. But lawmakers never lifted a ban on the agency that prevents it from conducting such research.
