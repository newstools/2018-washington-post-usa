The NHL world was hit with awful news Tuesday, when the Ottawa Senators announced that team captain Erik Karlsson and his wife, Melinda, had lost their unborn son. The couple had announced they were expecting in November, and the baby’s due date was reportedly in mid-April. “The collective thoughts and prayers of the Ottawa Senators organization, the city of Ottawa and entire hockey community rest with Erik and Melinda Karlsson following the loss of their son,” the Senators said in a statement. “We ask that you respect the family’s wishes for privacy during the grieving process.” Karlsson is in his ninth season with the Senators, who made him the 15th overall pick in the 2008 draft, and he has won the Norris Trophy twice while being selected for five all-star games. He married Melinda Currey in August, and in December, Karlsson posted a photo from a gender reveal party in which he learned that she was carrying a boy. You my boy blue.!!
