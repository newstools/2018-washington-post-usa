Mitt Romney gave 20 paid speeches from early 2017 to early 2018, earning him more than $1.5 million, according to a personal financial disclosure he filed with the U.S. Senate. Romney, who is running for a Senate seat in Utah, received between $15,000 and $137,000 per speech from February 2017 to February 2018. He gave speeches to organizations across an array of industries, including finance, media and insurance. He delivered a pair of speeches to the investment bank Goldman Sachs last year, earning $40,000 for each one. This year, NBCUniversal Media paid him $137,082 for a speech. Blue Cross Blue Shield gave him $100,000 for a speech last year. Deutsche Bank paid him more than $221,000 for two speeches. Romney’s filing shows $127,000 worth of speech earnings were paid to charities. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee is personally wealthy. During the 2012 campaign, his estimated worth was between $190 million and $250 million. His latest disclosure shows a long list of assets. Romney also earned more than $350,000 from his chairmanship of Solamere Capital and his position on the board of Marriott International. The Republican candidate is considered a heavy favorite to win the seat being vacated by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). Romney’s campaign said Friday he would release current and previous years’ tax returns as soon as his 2017 returns have been filed.
