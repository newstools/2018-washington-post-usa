A man was killed and two others were injured Thursday afternoon during a three-vehicle crash in the Largo area, authorities said. State police and Prince Georgeâ€™s County fire units responded to the crash on Route 202 at Watkins Park Drive where they found a collision that involved a U.S. Postal vehicle and two pickup trucks about 4:30 p.m., Maryland State police said. A man was fatally injured but police did not immediately identify him. Mark Brady, a fire department spokesman, said medics transported a man and a woman, who both sustained non-life threatening injuries, to a hospital.
