Rick Scott has scheduled a “big announcement” for April 9 that those close to the Republican expect will be the launch of his campaign for U.S. Senate. “Join me the morning of April 9th on Facebook Live, as I make a big announcement,” Scott wrote on Twitter on Monday. He also announced that Jackie Schutz Zeckman had resigned as his chief of staff and that Brad Piepenbrink would take over. The moves came as Republicans close to the governor predicted that he would launch a Senate campaign. For months, prominent Republicans have speculated that he will make a bid. “I hope that he runs, and I expect that he will run,” said Brian Ballard, a Republican fundraiser and close Scott ally. Two Republicans close to Scott speaking on the condition of anonymity expressed near full confidence that he would announce a challenge against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson on April 9. Joanna Burgos, a Scott adviser, said she had nothing to add to the governor’s tweet. “Stay tuned,” she said. A Scott candidacy could have a dramatic impact on the battle for the Senate majority.
