Four people were shot, two fatally, in three separate shooting incidents in Southeast Washington on Tuesday night and early Wednesday, according to D.C. police. No arrests have been made, and authorities said it does not appear any of the incidents are related. Two people were shot about 8 p.m. in the 4300 block of Seventh Street SE, near Barnaby Road in the Belmont Crossing apartment complex. Police said John Gaines, 53, who lived at the complex, was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other victim was taken to a hospital in critical condition. According to a police report, both victims were found in front of an apartment building. The person who survived was shot five times, the police report says. Gaines was shot in the chest. About 11:20 p.m., police said a man was found shot multiple times inside a second-floor apartment in the 4300 block of Wheeler Road SE, near Southern Avenue and the border with Maryland. Richard Anthony Banks, 47, was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead early Wednesday. Police said Banks lived in Southeast Washington, but also provided an address for him in Temple Hills, Md. Police said in a report there was a blood trail in the apartment building hallway leading to the apartment, and that officers had to force open the front door to get inside. Banks was lying on the floor. Police said a bullet went through an apartment door across the hall. D.C. police are also investigating a shooting that occurred about 2:20 a.m. Police said they were called to a residence in the 2600 block of Sheridan Road SE, near Barry Farm, and found a man who had been shot in the lower body. He was taken to a hospital with wounds that were not thought to be life-threatening. Police said that investigators think the man was shot near the Anacostia Freeway and Pennsylvania Avenue in Southeast, about two miles from where he was found. Police closed a portion of the highway for several hours as they searched for evidence.
