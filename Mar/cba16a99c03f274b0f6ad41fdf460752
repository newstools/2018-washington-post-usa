The stock market’s recovery from its first correction since 2016 was derailed this past week by President Trump’s tariff proposals and the new Federal Reserve chairman’s remarks on inflation. Aside from tweets about North Korea, bulls have embraced Trump’s initiatives — from financial deregulation to tax cuts. That hasn’t been the case since Wednesday, as concern he is dragging the world into a showdown over trade extended a sell-off. Trump’s decision to slap a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum sent global markets into a tantrum. “The market happened to like tax reform and infrastructure spending. But the market doesn’t like tariffs,” said Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Frank Capital Partners. Equities slid as Jerome H. Powell, who has vowed continuity with Fed predecessor Janet Yellen’s pace of interest-rate hikes, hinted the central bank may be faster on the draw than anticipated. “Powell surprised people by being a bit more frank than folks expected,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors. The Treasury will sell $51 billion of three-month bills and $45 billion of six-month bills Monday. They yielded 1.67 percent and 1.87 percent in when-issued trading. It will also sell four-week bills Tuesday. — Bloomberg News
