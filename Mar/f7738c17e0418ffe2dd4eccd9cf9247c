There’s something about Scandinavian interior design that sings in small spaces. The style’s signature clean lines, soft colors, functional furnishings and simple silhouettes can inject warmth and light into a cramped living area and create the illusion of additional square footage. “I love the Scandinavian minimal look — partly because my studio apartment in New York City is so small that I need clean lines in my design to make it feel layered but not cluttered,” says Gabrielle Savoie, design blogger at Savvy Home and MyDomaine editor. We asked Savoie to recommend some of her favorite Scandinavian furniture finds. “When I was decorating my own space, I started looking for budget alternatives to Scandinavian design classics to furnish my space without spending a ton,” she said.
