Two apparently naked people showed up at a hotel in Loudoun County Sunday, and two arrests were made, the county sheriff’s office said. They said the two arrived “unclothed” at a hotel in the 21000 block of Ridgetop Circle in the Sterling area Sunday afternoon. After deputies went to the hotel, two people from Sterling were arrested, the sheriff’s office said. They were identified as Brent A. Martinez, 36, and Maria Cano-Morales, 31. Each was charged with indecent exposure, the sheriff’s office said. No explanation for the incident was available immediately.
