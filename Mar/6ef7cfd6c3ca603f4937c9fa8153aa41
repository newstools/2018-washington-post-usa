A 70-year-old man died after a house fire in Prince George’s County. Fire officials said the home where he was found had no smoke alarms and used the incident as a chance to remind area residents to change the batteries in their alarms. The fire broke out just after 10 p.m. Sunday at a two-story, split-level home in the 4200 block of Monroe Street in Bladensburg. Fire officials later identified the man who died as William Mobley. Mark E. Brady, a spokesman for the Prince George’s County Fire, said in a statement the neighbors “did everything they possibly could including banging on the front door of the house, calling 911.” “There was nothing more they could do.” [Firefighter charged with arson in three fires, PG fire department says] When firefighters arrived, the fire was in the attic and on the roof. Inside, they found the man unconscious. He was taken to a hospital where he died a short time later, officials said. The cause of the fire, which caused about $150,000 in damage, is under investigation. Fire officials there were five fire fatalities in the county last year that were believed to be accidental in nature.

Officials advised area residents under a program called “Change your Clock — Change your Battery,” to check their fire alarms and that alarms that are older than 10 years should be replaced.
