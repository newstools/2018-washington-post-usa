Washington’s famed cherry trees signal the unofficial start of spring in the region. And it appears that for a third year in a row, spring will come early. The National Park Service announced Thursday that the blossoms are expected to reach peak bloom between March 17 and March 20. The historical average peak bloom date is April 4, said Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service. According to the organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, trees reached their green bud stage — the first of six stages leading to peak bloom — on Feb. 25. On average the trees do not reach this stage until the first week of March, according to The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang. National Park Service records indicate that this year’s green bud date ranks as the fifth earliest in the past 27 years. [Cherry blossom forecast: Peak bloom will come about a week early this year] That could signal another early peak bloom date for the cherry trees. Peak bloom is the day on which 70 percent of the blossoms along the Tidal Basin are open. In 2016 and 2017, peak bloom occurred on March 25, according to National Park Service records. If the trees reach peak about the same date, the blooms would coincide with the National Cherry Blossom Festival, which runs from March 20 through April 15. Considered the world’s largest U.S.-Japanese celebration, the festival commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo to the District. In past years, the festival has attracted an estimated 1.5 million visitors.
