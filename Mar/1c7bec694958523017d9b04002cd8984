2018 NCAA tournament interactive bracket Schedule and results | Top story lines | Tournament history Through two games Friday night, the remaining No. 1 seeds look as strong as ever. After Kansas survived a late push from Clemson in the Midwest region, Villanova pulled away from West Virginia in the East region, 90-78, in Boston to earn a trip to the Elite Eight. The Mountaineers’ in-your-face defense initially appeared to wear down the Wildcats in the second half. West Virginia took a six-point lead with 11 minutes to play. The Mountaineers forced Villanova into 17 turnovers. Sagaba Konate’s block on Mikal Bridges in the middle of that run epitomized the effect of WVU’s stifling “Press Virginia” approach. THE GREAT WALL OF KONATE!!! 🤚😱#MarchMadness #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/LHDxxShQkA But Villanova composed itself behind 27 points from Jalen Brunson and 18 points and eight rebounds from Omari Spellman. The Wildcats shot 50 percent from the floor for the game. Spellman’s block and dunk over Konate after Villanova retook the lead swung momentum back over to Coach Jay Wright’s squad. DO WE HAVE TO SPELL-MAN OUT FOR YOU?!?! BLOCK + SLAM as Villanova takes a 65-60 lead! #MarchMadness #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/Jx54UnSHkr Moments later, Brunson broke West Virginia’s press and Eric Paschall threw down another dunk over Konate. Paschall came in like a SuperNOVA! 😱😱😱#MarchMadness #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/5eNAxlt59c It was all good from there for Villanova, which will face the winner of Purdue and Texas Tech on Sunday. Kansas outlasts Clemson At least one college basketball blue blood has punched its ticket to the Elite Eight. Kansas warded off a late charge by Clemson for an 80-76 win in Omaha. The Jayhawks, the top seed in the Midwest region, led by as many as 20 in the second half, but Gabe DeVoe’s 31 points, a game-high, for Clemson, cut the lead down to six with a just more than a minute left, then four when Kansas struggled at the free throw line. Four players for KU scored in double figures, including a team-high 17 points from Malik Newman. Center Udoka Azubuike had 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting and 11 rebounds. The Jayhawks will face the winner of Duke and Syracuse. West Virginia putting the pressure on Villanova We may have found the game of the night: Villanova and West Virginia are locked in a heavyweight battle in Boston, and the Mountaineers lead, 60-54, halfway through the second half. Four West Virginia players have already scored in double figures, including 12 points and eight assists from Jevon Carter, and 10 points and seven rebounds from Sagaba Konate. Konate’s defense is helping out, too, like this filthy block on Mikal Bridges. THE GREAT WALL OF KONATE!!! 🤚😱#MarchMadness #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/LHDxxShQkA At the half, Villanova guard Jalen Brunson had 16 points already on 5-of-9 shooting. Daxter Miles Jr. had 11 points for the Mountaineers. The Wildcats, the top seed in the East region, struggled a bit against West Virginia’s in-your-face defense. They turned the ball over nine times, and sophomore guard Donte DiVincenzo, a key ballhandler off the bench, had four turnovers and three fouls. Follow this post for more real-time updates for tonight’s games. Kansas pulling away from Clemson at the half If the first day of Sweet 16 play was for the Cinderellas — Loyola Chicago, Kansas State, Florida State and Michigan — Friday night is for the evil stepsisters, specifically the Kansas Jayhawks, who made mincemeat of Clemson through the first half. KU took a 40-27 lead into the locker room after forcing the Tigers into 37 percent shooting and eight turnovers in the first 20 minutes. Clemson went six minutes without a field goal toward the end of the half, during which the Jayhawks, the top seed in the Midwest region, ripped off a 10-3 run. Kansas sophomore center Udoka Azubuike has dominated inside with 10 points and six rebounds, but also has two fouls. Then again, Clemson’s frontcourt is also in foul trouble: David Skara and Elijah Thompson, the two forwards sent to check Azubuike, have three and two fouls, respectively. If this keeps up, it will be a night of Rock Chalk Jayhawk. Villanova, West Virginia have at least one thing in common BOSTON — For all of the differences between Villanova and West Virginia — the clashing styles of play, the sartorial choices of their head coaches — both their leaders share common ground in discussing the one-and-done phenomenon in college basketball. Villanova Coach Jay Wright has never had a player leave for the professional ranks after one season; West Virginia Coach Bob Huggins hasn’t had a one-and-done since forward DerMarr Johnson in 2000 when he was coaching at Cincinnati. [ Brunson vs. Carter is a classic Sweet 16 matchup with roots in junior high ] “I’ve always thought the more time that young people could spend on a college campus, the better prepared they’re going to be for life. Whether it’s one, two, three, or four, you’re going to be more prepared for life,” Huggins said Thursday as he prepared his team to meet Wright’s Wildcats in the East Region semifinal on Friday night. “DerMarr Johnson, I think. Yeah, I think that’s the last one-and-done I had. Ask Calipari. I mean, he’s so much smarter about those kinds of things than I am.” Kentucky Coach John Calipari wasn’t around Boston to ask. But Wright was, and it was pertinent, given that the Big East earlier this week recommended a new two-or-none policy that would require players to stay in school for two years before turning pro. Wright said he supported Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman, who continued to push the two-and-done idea this week. “Val talked to all the coaches about that stuff and the athletic directors, and in general, we’re all in agreement with that paper she produced. We are all in agreement. There’s little different areas. In the postseason, I would go into it more in depth. But I just think there should be a relationship with the NCAA and the NBA because the whole issue is an NBA issue. These players should be allowed to come out of high school and go right to the NBA if they’re good enough, and if they’re good enough to be potential NBA players, they shouldn’t have to go to college if they don’t want to. They should be given an opportunity in the G League to earn the amount of money that they’re worth and not have to go to college.” [ Isaac Haas gets assist from Purdue engineering students, but he’s still unlikely to play ] That opened up more questions about Wright’s recruiting philosophy, which has been topic of discussion over the years given that he has not had a one-and-done and isn’t afraid to sit his younger players if they’re not ready. He has six redshirts on his roster, including junior starters Eric Paschall and Phil Booth, as well as redshirt sophomore Donte DiVincenzo, the Big East’s top sixth man. But Wright is also fighting the perception that he doesn’t pursue high-level prospects who might play just one season in college. He missed on a major Philadelphia-area recruit in 2018 five-star Cameron Reddish, who chose Duke over the Wildcats last September. “I don’t want it out there that I’m against one-and-dones. I don’t want it out there that I don’t want them. I want them. We try,” Wright said. “Certain ones, we really try. We just lost a local one that’s a great kid, and he’s going to be very successful, and he picked a great school, but we wanted him.” [ ‘I got shivers down my whole body’: Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life ] Big 12 pursues Sweet 16 domination OMAHA — In that annual, mid-round time frame where the original 68 teams had gone whittled to 12, the Big 12, that league with 10 teams, has already made a strong account of itself, just as it yearned to do two weeks ago when it adjourned its conference tournament. It joins the Atlantic Coast Conference by hogging eight of the last 12 teams standing, each of the two leagues with four representatives. Where the ACC had upheld the concept of March Madness as a semi-crapshoot of great pressure mingled strangely with limited merit — two months to decide a conference champion, one night to weed it out — the Big 12 has upheld its regular season. Where the ACC’s survivors finished second, tied for third, tied for eighth and tied for 10th across the long winter, the Big 12’s four survivors finished first, tied for second, tied for second and fourth. That fourth-place team, Kansas State, removed the last vestiges of the Southeastern Conference when it knocked off Kentucky in Atlanta, becoming the first Big 12 team to reach the final eight. “I’m proud of our league,” Kansas Coach Bill Self said here Thursday. “Our league was terrific. But in order to probably get the recognition that the year deserves from the league, you need to perform well in the tournament. And hopefully our four teams have put themselves in a decent position, but hopefully will play well this weekend to kind of solidify what we already know, is that it’s an unbelievable basketball league.” [ Kentucky Gentlemen? Wildcats chided for skipping handshakes after Sweet 16 loss. ] Inasmuch as anything as mad as March should serve as a solidification, the Big 12 had sought one. It has had a mostly rough decade in the savage frenzy of the big tournament. Since Kansas rose to the national title game in 2012, the league has had one Final Four entry, and that entry, Oklahoma in 2016, incurred the most thumping defeat in the history of the Final Four, 95-51, to Villanova. The Big 12 went 3-5 in 2013, 6-7 in 2014, 5-7 in 2015, 9-7 in 2016 and 9-6 in 2017. Of the 40 regional finalist spots offered in those five years, the Big 12 claimed only three — one in 2017 and two in 2016. While this Midwest Region played out like some ACC tournament even more far-flung than Brooklyn, Kansas figured to have the most fans here downtown as it took the spot opposite Clemson and amid Duke and Syracuse, also here. In Boston, both West Virginia and Texas Tech, those Big 12 brothers who reside 1,282 air miles apart, are set to play Friday night, albeit not each other. Kansas State in the South Region and the ACC’s Florida State in the West, a couple of motley No. 9 seeds, already had reached the weekend. A man who has reached 18 Sweet 16s dating back to 1977, when his team lost to Charlotte and Cedric “Cornbread” Maxwell, in a tournament with just 32 teams, noted this week that a Sweet 16 berth has surged in value. “When I started coaching,” Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said, “ … like, you had to make the Sweet 16 or else it was just awful. Now making the Sweet 16 is a very good thing, I don’t care who you are. I mean, obviously the 1 and 2 seeds expect it, but it’s still a good thing to get to the Sweet 16, because it’s pretty darn hard to do.” [ The Syracuse March Madness forecast: Cold, scoring in the 50s ] Schedule and Results Friday’s games (All times Eastern): Thursday’s results: Complete lunacy in the South Oh, South Region, you crazy, beautiful thing. After 11th-seeded Loyola Chicago continued its Cinderella run by reaching the region final, No. 9 Kansas State removed the last bulwark against complete lunacy by knocking off Kentucky, 61-58. [ Full game story: Bluegrass blue blood bounced as Kansas State ousts Kentucky in Sweet 16 ] Following the defeats of the top four seeds in the region before the Sweet 16, which had never happened before in tournament history, No. 5 Kentucky was left as the highest-seeded team and a strong favorite to reach the Final Four. Instead, Kansas State will vie for that honor against Loyola — in the first 9-vs.-11 matchup in tournament history. Only 17,676 of 17.3 million brackets have No. 9 K-State vs. No. 11 Loyola-Chicago in the Elite 8. https://t.co/7VOOqIO4Bp KSU’s Barry Brown Jr. sank the game-winning layup with 18 seconds left, but before his squad could celebrate it had to sweat out a late three-point attempt by Kentucky. When that shot bounced off the rim, Brown and Co. could celebrate their first-ever win over one of college basketball’s most prestigious programs. Xavier Sneed led Kansas State with 22 points, while P.J. Washington paced Kentucky with 18. In its losing effort, Coach John Calipari’s Wildcats connected on just three of 12 three-pointers, whereas KSU went nine for 22 from long range. WHAT A TAKE pic.twitter.com/VHCvSttv0Y Florida State takes out Gonzaga Gonzaga had entered Thursday on a 16-game winning streak, the longest of any team left in the tournament — and now Gonzaga is no longer left in the tournament. Ninth-seeded Florida State became the third of four teams in Thursday’s Sweet 16 action to spring an upset, pulling away from the fourth-seeded Bulldogs for a 75-60 win in the West region. [ Full game story: FSU gives Gonzaga big problems, pulls upset to advance ] Only the Seminoles’ upcoming opponent in the region final, third-seeded Michigan, managed to beat a lower-seeded team Thursday, as it trounced No. 7 Texas A&M earlier in the evening. FSU took large lead in the second half but saw Gonzaga creep to within 53-49 with 10 minutes left before going on a 22-11, game-ending run. Terance Mann’s 18 points led the Seminoles, who had 19 assists to the Bulldogs’ seven. Rui Hachimura led Gonzaga with 16 points, but his team shot poorly in every phase, going 20 of 59 from the field, including five of 20 on three-pointers, and 15 of 24 on free throws. FSU was barely better from three, just six of 20, but it got a variety of contributions to keep its foe at arm’s length for much of the game, as 11 players scored for the Seminoles. FSU reached the Elite Eight for the first time since 1993. #Noles dancing to the #Elite8! 🕺💃#MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/imiMWqGrJE Sister Jean happy that Loyola “broke” her bracket So what did Sister Jean, Loyola Chicago’s 98-year-old chaplain/super-fan, make of her squad’s win Thursday, propelling the No. 11 seed to a surprising berth in the South region final? She was, of course, delighted, and had no problem with the fact that the Ramblers “broke” her bracket. [ Sister Jean continues to steal the show at NCAA tournament ] Sister Jean told CBS after the upset of Nevada that Loyola’s Clayton Custer jokingly apologized for the win. She had picked her beloved Ramblers to reach the Sweet 16, making her among the few to have done so, but had them losing to Cincinnati in Thursday’s game. The Bearcats, of course, didn’t even get that far, blowing a 22-point lead in the second half to the Wolf Pack, but the latter team was unable to complete another sizable comeback, and Loyola is moving deeper into the tourney. Loyola-Chicago’s run to the Elite 8 is even surprising Sister Jean. pic.twitter.com/TTgWE4tY6s “I don’t care that you broke my bracket, I’m ready for the next one,” Sister Jean said she told Custer. ” … This is a great feat for us.” “I’m happy for us, for my community, for Loyola, for the city of Chicago and for the world,” Sister Jean told The Post’s Gene Wang, “because we have people watching us all over the world. The viewing numbers on every channel should go up over this weekend, and I’m sure that it will.” Dear #Elite8... make way for Sister Jean!#MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/ch1txCdz1H Loyola upsets Nevada, continues Cinderella run The Ramblers keep hitting big shots late in games — and, against the odds, they keep advancing in the NCAA tournament. Loyola Chicago’s latest upset came Thursday in the Sweet 16 when the 11th-seeded squad topped No. 7 Nevada, 69-68, to set up a showdown in the South regional final with the winner of the Kentucky-Kansas State game later in the evening. [ Full game story: Loyola Chicago, on a ‘Mission from God,’ is delivered by Marques Townes ] Loyola’s Marques Townes hit a three-point shot with six seconds left to give his squad a crucial four-point lead, and although Nevada’s Caleb Martin made a three-pointer of his own with two seconds to go, the Ramblers were able to run out the clock. Townes led his squad with 18 points, and teammates Clayton Custer and Aundre Jackson contributed 15 each. MARQUES TOWNES WITH THE BIG TIME 👌#MarchMadness #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/9LMUnm6Z2v Loyola-Chicago's 3 NCAA Tournament wins have come by a combined 4 points. That ties the smallest combined win margin by any team to win its first 3 games of a single tournament all time (1981 Saint Joseph's - 4). Caleb Martin led the Wolf Pack with 19 points, his twin brother Cody Martin had 16 and teammate Jordan Caroline chipped in with 19, but Nevada was unable to complete its third straight comeback from a double-digit deficit in the second half. After rallying from 22 points down against Cincinnati in the previous round, and from 14 down to Texas in the first round, the Wolf Pack did not panic went it fell behind by 40-28 with 16:42 left to play, but Loyola’s sharp shooting made the difference. The Ramblers started the second half by going 13-for-13 from the field, and although the Wolf Pack made it close at the end, Townes had the answer, following clutch shots made in the two previous rounds by Custer and Donte Ingram. No one was happier than Loyola’s sudden-celebrity superfan, Sister Jean, the team’s 98-year-old chaplain. ❤️#MarchMadness #SisterJean pic.twitter.com/VBpRh5ZEFW Michigan trounces Texas A&M Texas A&M was only outscored by three in the second half, so the Aggies had that going for them. Unfortunately, they had already spotted the Wolverines a 24-point lead in the first 20 minutes, leaving little doubt as to which team would emerge to play in the West regional final against the winner of the Gonzaga-Florida State game later on Thursday evening. [ Full game story: Michigan lines up its threes and connects with rout of Texas A&M ] No. 3 Michigan hit a scorching 39 of 63 shots from the field for a .619 percentage, including 14 of 24 three-pointers. A tournament-record eight Wolverines made at least one three, including freshman walk-on C.J. Baird, who was elevated early in the season from team manager and whose make with 32 seconds left put a raucous capper on his team’s rout. What a moment for @baird_cj. Started as a student manager and turned into a walk-on as a freshman this season. Can now say that he made a three-pointer in the Sweet 16. The bench’s reaction makes it so much better, too. pic.twitter.com/YCOEmA1gUi Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman led Michigan with 24 points, while Tyler Davis paced Texas A&M with 24. Davis and fellow big man Robert Williams had been giving opponents fits as an imposing inside duo, but they couldn’t keep up with the Wolverines’ hot shooting, and the Aggies hurt their cause by committing 13 turnovers. Top story lines — Many of the tournament’s biggest stars exited last weekend, including Oklahoma’s Trae Young, Texas’s Mohamed Bamba, Missouri’s Michael Porter Jr., Michigan State’s Jaren Jackson Jr. and Alabama’s Collin Sexton. That exodus sets up a strange Sweet 16, especially for curious NBA fans. Duke’s Marvin Bagley III is perhaps the last elite NBA prospect remaining, and gets a chance on college basketball’s brightest stage to prove why he should viewed as be the top player in the draft. Kentucky freshman Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is arguably the best point guard available in June’s NBA draft, and he could also seize a Final Four platform. — Without star players, there will be intense focus on the remaining coaches, who include some of the sport’s biggest names: John Calipari, Jay Wright, Bill Self, Bob Huggins, Jim Boeheim, John Beilein, and, of course, Mike Krzyzewski. And as John Feinstein observed last week, Coach K is in his 43rd season, but he shows no signs of slowing down. — Loyola is probably the unlikeliest of the Sweet 16 teams, where the announced home attendances this year included 1,135, 1,289, 1,133, 1,904, 1,914 and 1,501. The Post’s Chuck Culpepper will take you on a lovely tour of the school’s Chicago campus, a place sports-unaddicted enough that student upon student will tell you they never even heard of Loyola’s 1963 basketball national title. — If Loyola is the most surprising Sweet 16 team, Texas A&M might be the most overlooked. The Aggies were once ranked No. 5 in the country, then lost seven of their next nine, and entered the tournament as an afterthought in a region packed with Final Four prospects.
