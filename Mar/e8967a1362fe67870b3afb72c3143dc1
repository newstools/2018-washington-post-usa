A 22-year-old Montgomery County woman killed her 80-year-old great-grandmother, then ran from her house and was quickly captured by police with blood on one of her arms, authorities said Saturday. Shannon Marci Jefferson Lozano was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Doris Elizabeth Shelton, county police said. Lozano was ordered jailed without bond and is expected to appear in court Monday, police said. Lozano lived at the house in the 10500 block of Cascade Place in Wheaton with her great- grandparents. According to court records filed Saturday, Lozano’s great-grandfather left the home sometime Friday afternoon. That’s when Lozano allegedly attacked her great-grandmother. Shortly after 3 p.m. Friday, the victim’s husband returned home to find his wife unresponsive and not breathing and called 911, court records say. He also said he’d seen his great-granddaughter running away, according to police accounts filed in court. Police and medics arrived at the home, where Shelton was pronounced dead. Court records state that she suffered from blunt-force trauma and “multiple cutting injuries.” Officers from the Maryland-National Capital Park Police apprehended Lozano a short distance from the house, Montgomery police said in a statement. They said while being questioned by investigators, Lozano “made a statement implicating herself in the assault of her great-grandmother.” Police did not disclose a motive in the killing. Shelton’s body was taken to the chief medical examiner’s office for an autopsy. The case stunned residents along Cascade Place, about a mile north of the Capital Beltway. They said the couple had lived in the neighborhood for many years. “They have been nice neighbors,” said Lana Turner.
