The U.S. Coast Guard is warning mariners of hazardous conditions off the North Carolina coast after a cargo ship lost 70 containers amid high winds and heavy seas over the weekend. In a statement Sunday, authorities warned of “navigation hazards” roughly 17 miles off Oregon Inlet on North Carolina’s outer banks. A nor’easter stretching from Maine to North Carolina pummeled the East Coast with violent winds, rain and flooding — with gusts approaching hurricane-force levels in some parts of the Atlantic over the weekend.
