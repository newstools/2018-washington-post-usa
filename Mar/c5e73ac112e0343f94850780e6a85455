Police have identified the man who fatally shot himself outside the White House on Saturday as a 26-year-old Alabama resident. Cameron Ross Burgess, of Maylene, Ala., approached the White House’s north fence line about 11:46 a.m., pulled out a handgun and fired several shots — none of which were directed at the White House, D.C. police said Sunday. Burgess was standing before a crowd of more than 100 people when he shot himself, according to witnesses. After pulling the gun, those in the crowd reported, he fell to the ground as onlookers fled.

Burgess’s remains were taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for an autopsy, D.C. police said.
