It’s not often that being corny pays off. Homemade puns normally just elicit a groan. But for 6-year-old Leo Moeller of New York, a years-long one-upmanship competition with his father consisting of who could come up with a better dad joke ended with a pretty cool outcome. “He and I both have our share of terrible jokes,” said his father, Josh Moeller, who has made it a ritual to read Leo’s favorite kids’ magazine, Ranger Rick, with his son at bedtime. Over the summer, Josh Moeller helped Leo submit what Leo firmly believed was his best joke to Ranger Rick’s Reader Riddle section. About two weeks ago, his parents saw that Leo’s joke was one of six kid-authored jokes published by the animal-themed magazine in its March issue. Leo’s mother, Jamie Boileau, filmed the moment Leo figured it out. Before Leo reads the joke, he introduces it in true comedic form by saying, “You guys are going to love this one.” “What do parrots dip their … ” he begins. And then Leo realizes it’s his joke. He’s so overwhelmed that he never even gets to the punchline: “squawk-amole.” Happy Monday, everyone. local  inspired-life       true Inspired Life newsletter Weekly inspiration to improve your life.
