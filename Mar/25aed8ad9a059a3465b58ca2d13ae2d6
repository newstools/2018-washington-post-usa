* High-wind warning through 6 a.m. Saturday * Power outage tracker | School closings | Fed closed | Weather wreaking havoc locally | Forecast through the weekend 1:05 p.m. update Winds remain extreme. At 1 p.m., the wind at Reagan National Airport was sustained at 40 mph, gusting to 58 mph, which is tropical-storm force. Peak gusts in the past hour have hovered near 60 mph (Reagan National clocked 59 and 62 mph gusts and Dulles clocked a 60 mph gusts) – not quite as high as the 11 a.m. hour when Dulles clocked a 71 mph gust, but still dangerously high. Power outage numbers have reached 450,000, which is more than during Sandy in October 2012. Short-term modeling suggests peak gusts will remain in the 50 to 60 mph range over the next few hours before slowly easing a bit this evening. We still cannot rule out some 60-plus mph gusts through the afternoon as these winds sometimes come in sudden bursts which are hard to anticipate in advance. The National Weather Service has logged well over 100 reports of damaging winds since early Friday morning. Fairfax County Fire and Rescue tweeted it had responded to 569 requests for help including 47 cases of trees falling into homes. (Scroll down below for earlier updates). Overview A powerful Nor’easter exploding off the coast of the Northeast is causing one of the worst wind storms in the region in years. Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph have downed scores of trees around the Washington region, and power outage numbers have surged into the six figures.  Bursts of potentially dangerous winds for both motorists and pedestrians will continue through the afternoon. More trees could fall and power outages will continue. This is a long duration wind event. Key points Peak gusts Dahlgren, Va. – 75 Dulles Airport, Va. – 71 Ballenger Creek, Md. – 69 Gaithersburg, Md. – 69 Upper Marlboro, Md. – 67 Patuxent River, Md. – 66 Catholic University, D.C. – 66 Sabillasville, Md. – 64 Flint, Md. – 62 Andrews AFB, Md – 62 Washington National, Va. – 62 Leesburg, Va. – 61 Winchester, Va. – 61 Chaptico, Md. – 60 Manassas, Va. – 60 Link: More complete list Earlier updates Noon update Winds ticked up over the last hour and continue wreaking havoc around the region. Remarkably, Dulles Airport clocked a gust to 71 mph at 11:39 a.m., which matches its peak gust during the June 2012 derecho. More trees are falling and power outage numbers have spiked to nearly 400,000. We’re also seeing spotty reports of structural damage to homes and buildings.  The Chesapeake Bay Bridge was closed for traffic in the last hour and, on the U.S. 40 Hatem Bridge in northeast Maryland, a truck overturned due to the high winds.  Other peak gusts in the last hour: Fredericksburg, Va.: 61 mph Manassas, Va.: 59 mph Andrews Air Force Base, Md.: 61 mph Ft. Belvoir, Va: 60 mph Camp David, Md.: 59 mph At Reagan National Airport, which was gusting to 54 mph at noon, winds have gusted over 40 mph for the past 12 hours. 11:05 a.m. update Winds continue ripping across the region, trees are still coming down, and power outage numbers are escalating, up over 325,000 now. We’ve even seen reports of structural damage, such as this chimney taken out by the wind in Falls Church, Va.:  While gusts to near 50 mph are most common, occasional damaging gusts over 60 mph are unleashed. Upper Marlboro clocked a gust to 67 mph around 10:30 a.m. At 11:00 a.m., winds were near tropical-storm force at Dulles Airport, sustained at 37 mph, and gusting to 53 mph. 10 a.m. update Wind gusts in the 40 to 60 mph range continue to lash the region. Gusts at both Reagan National and Dulles at 10 a.m. were around 50 mph, with wind sustained in the 20 to 35 mph range. The damaging wind reports to the National Weather Service continue to pile up at feverish pace. The map below is a graphic representation:   In the last hour, the most impressive gust was 69 mph clocked at Patuxent River, Md. The one piece of somewhat encouraging news, as Ian Livingston discussed in his last report, is that the period of widespread extreme gusts, from 60 to 70 mph, may have already come through earlier this morning. That said, gusts in the 50 to 60 mph range and isolated higher levels are likely through the afternoon.
