The soccer world was stunned Sunday by the death of Davide Astori, the 31-year-old captain of Fiorentina, with one calling him “the best expression of an old-fashioned world, one that people have left behind.” The defender’s body was discovered in his hotel room when he failed to join players for breakfast at their hotel just before their match in Udine, in northeast Italy. Fiorentina’s game was called off, along with all fixtures in the top two divisions. “The belief is that the player died of a cardiac arrest by natural causes,” Udine prosecutor Antonio De Nicolo told the Associated Press. “It is strange that such a thing should happen to a professional who is so closely monitored without there being any warning signs.” An autopsy is being performed on Astori, who is survived by his wife and 2-year-old daughter. “This is a tragedy,” Chelsea Coach Antonio Conte, who coached Italy from 2014 to 2016, said. “This news really hurt me and it’s very difficult in this moment to find the right words for the family. … He was a great player, especially a fantastic guy.” Astori was a 14-time member of Italy’s national team and joined Fiorentina in 2015. Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon, a former Italy goalkeeper, chose to comment publicly, lauding him as “one of the best sports figures I came up against” on Instagram and Facebook. “I have hardly publicly expressed a thought about a person, because I have always let the beauty and uniqueness of relationships, mutual esteem and affection, not be exploited or disposed of to those who do not have the delicacy to respect certain links,” he wrote (Facebook translation). Ciao caro Asto, difficilmente ho espresso pubblicamente un pensiero riguardo una persona, perché ho sempre lasciato che la bellezza e l'unicità di rapporti, di reciproca stima e affetto, non venissero strumentalizzati o gettati in pasto a chi non ha la delicatezza per rispettare certi legami. Nel tuo caso, sento di fare un'eccezione alla mia regola, perché hai una moglie giovane e dei familiari che staranno soffrendo,ma soprattutto la tua piccola bimba, merita di sapere che il suo papà era a tutti gli effetti una PERSONA PERBENE…..una GRANDE PERSONA PERBENE….eri l'espressione migliore di un mondo antico, superato, nel quale valori come l'altruismo, l'eleganza, l'educazione e il rispetto verso il prossimo, la facevano da padroni. Complimenti davvero, sei stata una delle migliori figure sportive nella quale mi sono imbattuto. R.I.P. Il tuo folle Gigi.

A great decent person …. You were the best expression of an old-fashioned world,” Buffon said, “one that people have left behind, and which was governed by values like altruism, elegance, politeness and respect toward others. “Genuine compliments, you were one of the best sporting figures I ever came up against.” Un grande giocatore ma ancora piu grande persona… quante battaglie insieme a cagliari poi ritrovati a roma… ancora non ci posso credere… 😢😢 i miei pensieri anche alla sua famiglia e vicini… RIP🙏🏻🙏🏻 A post shared by  Radja Nainggolan (@radjanainggolan.4) on Mar 4, 2018 at 3:12am PST  Radja Nainggolan, who was a teammate of Astori’s with Cagliari and Roma, wrote on Instagram: “A great player, but even more than that, a great person … How many battles we were in together at Cagliari, then found each other again at Roma … I still can’t believe it … My thoughts are with his family and those close to him … RIP.” His first team, AC Milan, remembered him as “a man who loved football and grew up as a footballer with us.”     Most players, like former teammate Borja Valero, were in disbelief. “I can’t believe it,” he tweeted, “I don’t want to believe it … it’s surreal.
