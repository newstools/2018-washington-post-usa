A man who authorities said fatally shot himself Wednesday afternoon near the National Postal Museum has been identified as a 57-year-old from Falls Church, Va., according to D.C. police. Charles Scott Berridge was pronounced dead at the scene of the 1:30 p.m. shooting in the first block of Massachusetts Avenue NE, between North Capitol and First streets near Union Station. Police on Wednesday said the shooting had occurred on an alley or side street; on Thursday police said it occurred at the front entrance to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shares an address and a building with the postal museum. The entrance is on First Street NE, just across from a side entrance to Union Station, and 300 feet from Massachusetts Avenue. Police said a gun was recovered from the scene and the death is being investigated as an apparent suicide; authorities did not comment on why the man may have shot himself. In addition to having lived in Northern Virginia, public records show Berridge, who often went by Scott, once lived in an apartment building a few blocks from Union Station.
