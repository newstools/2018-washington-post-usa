This is no longer a market that mixes relentless gains with the occasional sharp downdraft. For the third week, the S&P 500 reversed some or all of the prior week’s performance. This time it fell, albeit with 2018’s smallest decline, after climbing 3.5 percent in the previous five days. The seesawing is a lens on investor psychology, underlining incompatible narratives that are developing in the wake of the S&P 500’s first correction in two years. Bulls such as JPMorgan Chase’s Marko Kolanovic cite robust earnings growth as a reason to have faith in the recovery. The White House looms as a threat. President Trump provided much of the downward impetus this past week, ousting his secretary of state and blocking a $117 billion technology deal as trade tensions simmer. “Longer term, we’re facing a risk-off mentality due to political risk,” said Chad Morganlander, a portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.5 percent on the week. The Nasdaq 100 Index was down 1.1 percent. The Treasury will sell $51 billion of three-month bills and $45 billion of six-month bills Monday. They yielded 1.81 percent and 1.97 percent in when-issued trading. It will also sell four-week bills Tuesday and $11 billion of 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities Thursday. — Bloomberg News
