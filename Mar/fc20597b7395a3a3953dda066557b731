The ACC men’s basketball tournament continues Wednesday with four second-round games at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center. Here’s the full bracket with start times and broadcast information. And keep up with the Big East, Big 12 and SEC tournaments, which are also ongoing.  All times Eastern. FIRST ROUND Game 1: No. 12 seed Boston College 87, No. 13 seed Georgia Tech 77 Skinny: Ky Bowman had 26 points, 10 rebounds and six assists as Boston College won the tournament’s opening game in front of what the Associated Press described as “a sparse crowd.” The Eagles never trailed in the game, also getting a career-high 20 points from sophomore forward Nik Popovic and 19 points from Jerome Robinson. The Eagles led by as many as 20 points in the second half before closing out the win from the free throw line. Boston College’s last three ACC tournament victories have all come over Georgia Tech, which finished 13-19. Boston College (18-14) will play N.C. State on Wednesday. Game 2: No. 10 seed Notre Dame 67, No. 15 seed Pittsburgh 64 Skinny: Bonzie Colson scored 19 points in his third game back from injury, and the Fighting Irish needed their star forward to hold off the last-place Panthers, 67-64 in their tournament opener. Colson made two from the line with 22.3 seconds left that all but gave Notre Dame the breathing room it needed. Colson missed 15 games with a broken left foot before returning last week to play the final two games of the regular season; the Irish are now 13-4 with Colson in the lineup. Notre Dame still needs a good showing at Barclays Center to possibly secure an NCAA tournament bid. — Associated Press [Miami is already in love with 5-foot-7 Chris Lykes.

Wake Forest dropped to 1-7 all-time against Syracuse with the loss. It was the first postseason meeting between the schools. — Associated Press SECOND ROUND Game 4: No. 9 seed Louisville 82, No. 8 seed Florida State 74 Skinny: Quentin Snider scored 19 points, and the Cardinals led by as many as 26 points in the second half before hanging on to beat the Seminoles. Ray Spalding added 18 points and Deng Adel had 15 points and eight rebounds for Louisville, which is firmly on the bubble for the NCAA tournament. Florida State, which had won at least one game in the ACC tournament in each of the past six seasons, got a team-high 14 points each from reserve guards Trent Forrest and PJ Savoy.

Robinson scored 26 points and fellow North Carolinian Ky Bowman had 24 in the win. North Carolina State wiped out a double-digit deficit in the final 10 minutes and tied it five times down the stretch but couldn’t finish its comeback. The Wolf Pack are still in fine shape for an at-large NCAA bid. — Associated Press Game 6: No. 7 seed Virginia Tech (21-10, 10-8) vs. No. 10 Notre Dame (19-13, 8-10) When: Wednesday, 7 p.m., ESPN2/ACC Network.
