FIRST ROUND Game 1: No. 9 seed St. John’s 88, No. 8 seed Georgetown 77 Skinny: Shamorie Ponds returned from an abdominal strain and scored 26 points and the Red Storm took over in the second half to beat the Hoyas in the first round of the Big East tournament on Wednesday night. Marvin Clark II scored 11 of his 16 points in the second half andSt. John’s (16-16) beat Georgetown (15-15) in the first round for the second straight year. It also was St. John’s first win over Georgetown in three games this season and its sixth win in nine games overall. Jessie Govan had 28 points and 11 rebounds for the Hoyas, but only eight points came in the second half. Marcus Derrickson added 20 points for Georgetown, which has lost five in a row. — Associated Press [Patrick Ewing’s first season as Georgetown coach ends with loss to St. John’s] Game 2: No. 7 seed Marquette 72, No. 10 seed DePaul 69 Skinny: Andrew Rowsey scored 25 points and seventh-seeded Marquette blew a 14-point lead and came back to outlast 10th-seeded DePaul in the opening round of the Big East tournament on Wednesday night. Sam Hauser added 16 points and hit two big free throws with 33 seconds to play as the Golden Eagles (19-12) handed the Blue Demons (11-20) their fourth-straight opening-round loss in the tournament. DePaul had a chance to win the game in the final seconds but Max Strus, who scored 19 of his 22 points in the second half, missed an open three-pointer with Marquette clinging to a 70-69 lead. Rowsey got the rebound and was fouled, making two free throws with less than a second to play. — Associated Press QUARTERFINALS Game 3: No. 1 seed Xavier (27-4, 15-3) vs. No. 9 seed St. John’s (16-16, 4-14) When: Thursday, noon, Fox Sports 1. Skinny: Xavier notched a few program firsts this season, including its first Big East regular season title — the first time in five years Villanova hadn’t won the crown. Xavier also surpassed the No. 5 ranking in the Associated Press poll for the first time in program history. The Musketeers enter the conference tournament ranked No. 3 in the nation and are in line to knock out another first: their first No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Game 4: No. 4 seed Creighton (21-10, 10-8) vs. No. 5 seed Providence (19-12, 10-8). When: Thursday, 2:30 p.m., Fox Sports 1. Skinny: Creighton shot its way into the NCAA tournament with one of the highest-powered offenses in the nation, but the Bluejays are well-rounded, too. Junior guard Khyri Thomas earned his second consecutive Big East defensive player of the year nod this week to become the 10th player to win the award more than once. Providence finished tied for third in the Big East with Seton Hall and Creighton, and it is likely to reach the NCAA tournament for the fifth consecutive year. Game 5: No. 2 seed Villanova (27-4, 14-4) vs. Marquette (19-12, 9-9). When: Thursday, 7 p.m., Fox Sports 1. Skinny: Villanova failed to win the Big East regular season title for the first time since 2013, though the Wildcats should still earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. They should also be pleased with four days’ rest before their first Big East tournament game — two of their final three regular season games went to overtime, including an 89-83 loss at Creighton. Marquette, which ousted DePaul for its third straight win in Wednesday’s first round, lost both regular season contests against the Wildcats, including a close three-point loss at home Jan. 28.

When: Thursday, 9:30 p.m., Fox Sports 1. Skinny: Seton Hall and Butler meet again just days after the Pirates beat the Bulldogs, 77-70, in both teams’ regular season finale. Butler’s LaVall Jordan, like Patrick Ewing at Georgetown, is a first-year coach heading his alma mater and looking to make a mark in his first Big East tournament.
