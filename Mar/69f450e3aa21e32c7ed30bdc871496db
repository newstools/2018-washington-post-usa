An NPR report on Good Friday described Easter inaccurately and, in doing so, practically begged Christians to renew charges that the media is biased against them. “Easter — the day celebrating the idea that Jesus did not die and go to hell or purgatory or anywhere like that, but rather arose into heaven — is on Sunday,” read an article on NPR’s website. Easter, in fact, is the day when Christians celebrate their belief in the earthly resurrection of Jesus. Many Christians believe that Jesus did go to hell (temporarily) after being crucified on Good Friday. The Apostle’s Creed, recited in many churches, states that Jesus “was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell.” Christians do not believe that Jesus “arose into heaven” — not right away, anyway — but rather spent 40 days on Earth, appearing to his disciples and hundreds of others, before ascending into heaven. NPR quickly corrected the report, describing Easter simply as “the day Christians celebrate Jesus’ Resurrection.” An NPR spokeswoman declined to say how the erroneous description of Easter reached publication. Sean Hannity, who is Catholic, has railed against “the mainstream media’s hostility toward Christianity,” expressing a popular sentiment. NPR’s mangling of Easter may only add to such perceptions.
