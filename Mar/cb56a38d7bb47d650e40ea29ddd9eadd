This is a short video about a school that is part of a project called Schools of Opportunity, which I have written about over the past several  years. So far, 45 schools have been recognized by the project — housed at the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder — for their efforts to provide opportunities for all students to learn no matter what their family circumstance. The focus is on opportunity gaps — not the achievement gap. The video above features a young man named Dayshaun and his path to become a school leader at one of this year’s Schools of Opportunity honorees — Seaside High School in California. The school is one of eight honored in the project in 2017, for using team-taught classes and an innovative curriculum. You can read about the other 2017 honorees here. [ Here are eight ‘Schools of Opportunity’ that do extraordinary things for students ] The Schools of Opportunity project started in 2014 as a pilot in New York and Colorado, and went national in 2015-16. Schools that are honored are assessed on a range of factors, including how well the adults in a school building  provide health and psychological support for students as well as judicious and fair discipline policies, and broad and enriched curriculum. It is based on research that clearly shows that students learn more when they have rich opportunities and fall behind when denied those opportunities. The video is a product of ATTN:, an issues-driven media company, and The Partnership for the Future of Learning, a network of educators, advocates, leaders, and supporters dedicated to an affirmative, equitable, evidence-based vision of a remodeled education system. The project is now accepting applications for 2018 until April 9. Information and forms are available online at: www.SchoolsofOpportunity.org.
