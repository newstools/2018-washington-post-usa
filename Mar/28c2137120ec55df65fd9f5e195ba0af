Although it may be overshadowed in Washington’s weather memory by Friday’s ferocious windstorm, our February nevertheless finished with many meteorological distinctions. Its high average temperature, as recorded at Reagan National Airport, meant it was the third-warmest February in Washington’s weather history, according to the National Weather Service. The average temperature of 45.3 degrees was 6.3 degrees above normal. The warmest February was last year. That meant that the past two years have had two of the three warmest Februaries here. It was foggy, with fog observed on 18 days. It was also wet: Total precipitation was almost twice the normal. But that liquid eminence came without much contribution from snow. Total snowfall was reported at one-fifth of an inch.
