A 16-year-old suspect has been arrested in the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old late last year in Southeast Washington, the D.C. police said. The victim was identified as James Anthony Smith, of Southeast. He had been shot Dec.18 on a basketball court and found nearby, in the 1900 block of Frederick Douglass Court. When he was found, near the basketball court, he was without shoes. His mother had said whoever shot him had taken his sneakers. They were red Air Jordans, and they were an early Christmas present from his mother. Police said the suspect also lived in Southeast Washington. He was arrested Friday and charged with felony murder, they said.
