Question: Is it safe to assume that the proposal to combine annual leave and sick leave would result in federal workers getting less? Answer: All full-time federal employees earn 13 days of sick leave per year plus 13, 20 or 26 days of annual leave (vacation) depending on their years of service. Part-time employees get prorated amounts. The White House budget plan last month proposed combining them into what would be called paid time off, although it didn’t specify that it would cause a reduction in the total. A follow-up document said, “This proposal would reduce the total number of leave days accrued by an employee annually,” although it didn’t specify by how many. That would have to be decided if the proposal starts moving in Congress. Other issues would include how much leave employees could carry over from year to year and what would happen when they leave the government. Currently, there are limits on accumulating annual leave, and the value of unused leave is paid in a lump sum at separation regardless of retirement eligibility. Sick leave accumulates without limit and is credited as time actually worked toward a retirement annuity, but it has no cash value for those ineligible to retire.
