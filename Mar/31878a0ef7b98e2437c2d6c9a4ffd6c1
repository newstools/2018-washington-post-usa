A man was critically injured in a stabbing late Friday morning on a sidewalk outside the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Shaw, according to D.C. police. Authorities said the attack was not random and occurred during an argument shortly before noon near Eighth and N streets in Northwest. Police Chief Peter Newsham said the suspected attacker was also injured and was taken to a hospital. He is under arrest, and formal charges are pending, Newsham said. The exact nature of the argument had not been determined, police said. It occurred on a sidewalk in front of a fitness center that operates out of the north end of the convention center, away from the main entrance. Police said the victim had been stabbed several times. Homicide detectives are investigating because of the seriousness of the injuries. It occurred across the street from a charter school; students were let out a side entrance.
